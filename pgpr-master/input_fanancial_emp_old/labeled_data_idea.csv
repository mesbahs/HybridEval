Community endowments benefit three core users: businesses- non-profits- and individuals. The investment arm of a community endowment creates wealth through investment and support for local businesses. Profit from the investment activity is distributed as a dividend to shareholders who then spend this money in the local economy. Lastly- the other portion of profit is granted to non-profits which through their work raise community aura- thus circling back to benefit businesses and individuals. The community endowment concept draws on existing institutions; however- the novelty is in pairing an investment group- a co-operative mutual fund- and a community foundation under a single partnership. Instead of wealth concentrating in the hands of a few- it's distributed to residents interested in becoming a shareholder. This creates not only supplementary income but also a sense of ownership and pride in community. Create a small experimental group of ten to twenty friends willing to invest $50 into a co-operative mutual fund or credit union like structure. Then- invest the sum amount in a local business through a low interest bearing micro-loan. Take the profits and distribute a portion to the shareholders and then the remainder to a non-profit that supports community and economic development. See how the non-profit's actions might have benefited either the business- shareholders- or both! There is potential for this idea but many obstacles as well. The early obstacles are establishing a legal structure and ensuring the protection and stewardship of the shareholders' investment. Secondly- how can consistent profitability be generated so that shareholders receive a dividend? What can non-profits do to ensure their work is felt by businesses and citizens?

The main players would be existing and new entrepreneurs - existing and new farmers- associations supporting the local business and the government in the respective area. These key players will get access to finance- training and education on how to use new money and increase in quality of their life and increase in lower level of community I would like to answer this with- again- my project Joint venture between ASA - OCF in Ethiopia. ASA will create alliance with OCF- coffee growers- and will provide them with funds. Also ASA will transfer their knowledge and expertise to empower and train the common businessman and new entrepreneurs in how to use new money and how to create sustainable business. Microfinance will be important tool because it will provide easy access to small amount of money to common population. As explained- we can float a small venture in the region rich either with resources or with human capital. we will have to create the long term goal and long term profitability by identifying the scarcity of the market- local or global- and train & educate the local entrepreneurs in the particular field. This can be done in small scale but the timeline has to be defined and identified accordingly. I would need IDEO's expertise in challenging the idea from basic. Also I would need IDEO to help me create better plan and explore more sustainable and profitable business plan to elevate the current economic situation. An individual,1,1,1,1,1

They will then teach their friends Our hypothesis is that poor households have gotJan Dhan bank accounts(J)- Aadhar cards (A)and most of them have mobile phones (M). This is called the JAM trinity in India.They now need to get the mobile phone linked to their account- get alerts and an MMID number. They need tolearn to use their debit cards at an ATM. We may test this soon in one of 272 wards in Delhi. This will enable them to receive money directly into their accounts. We will then get govt benefits/wages credited directly Has a similar easy step approach been used anywhere else . If it has worked and is documented then it would be great if links could be provided or documents uploaded. A group brainstorm,1,1,1,1,1

This idea will benefit all school-going children. This is meant to sharpen their minds. teach them how to think and push them to explore financial options at a young age- which will make them wiser adults in financial matters. It also aims at tapping out the true potential and figuring out the subject towards which the child is inclined. School teachers and the parents of the children will be actively involved in making this idea work. Using the power of spirit of competition- this idea will bring out the best of the minds together in order to make children financially competent. Cause As you sow- so you reap.

Why couldn't they get together to buy more- share this and safe money instead? This idea is targeting families and singles who are frequent internet shoppers. A community's power is stronger than the sum of each individual. This can also be related to the power of the customers against suppliers. A community would be able to get cheaper prices for groceries- clothes and other commodities buy collecting their demand and forcing the suppliers to lower the price. Collect the demand of notebooks at the beginning of a new semester in my students club and get the cheapest price online. See how much you can share and which commodities can be purchased via this approach. The experiment could be enlarged by saving demand for an order of new clothes when seasons change. Do you think collecting the demand and scheduling the orders will work via an app? How could the community search for the cheapest offers? An individual,3,3,3,3,3
329E6HTMSWEBUAKCK444YFI6JW4K3S,329E6HTMSWEBUAKCK444YFI6JW4K3S, Using our kids to help our communities from an early age This idea will benefit both parents and children. From an early age- parents can teach their children about the importance of money and helping others by implementing some rules in their households. For example- if their kids misbehaved in day core/school- the parents take away their treats and save it for the kids that are poor. This way the kids behave- parents help out another family in need. Parents can share their household rules with neighbors and families. The family may decide to adopt the same rule for their family or similar ones. The end game is to teach their kids that there is poor families out there that needs support and parents can contribute to another family's need without having to take money out of their budget. When the children comes to the age of having a piggy bank- they can discipline them by taking $1 out every time they misbehave. An individual,2,2,2,3,2

(UPDATE 5/31/15) This experience would benefit high school seniors and their families- by teaching students the basic structure and function of the stock market and engaging them in a unique opportunity to take part. This could develop as a new extension of already existing non-profit educational programs- and incentivize young people the way the real world incentivizes adults- with cash rather than grades- allowing them to learn about their role as future choice makers in a consumer-driven economy. By gaining sponsorship from local businesses- the Mock Stock program could be run through a local YMCA or rec center on weekday afternoons and function like an afterschool club or sport. It would provide students who are interested in economics with an opportunity to explore the world of Wall Street using small amounts of money in reward for smart choices. TD Ameritrade might even donate their online educational tools if it means helping raise the next generation of buyers... I could offer 3rd party workshops via Rainbow Tutoring- my friend's boutique tutoring company here in LA- which caters manly to high school students. A $5 buy in at the beginning of the program would be pooled and then rewarded to the student with the highest gain at the end. An experiment like this would allow us to gauge the willingness of teens to participate in a program like this- and track their interest so that the course structure could be amended for optimal engagement in the future. OpenIDEO community members with more advanced knowledge of the stock market could greatly enhance this concept- contributing the details necessary for a more accurate replication of the real thing. Community members who have experience teaching and leading teenagers would be able to advise us on how to make sure the students enjoyed their experience and felt motivated to learn and experiment. It’s important that the kids feel they walk away from their Mock Stock experience with useful knowledge. An individual,2,2,2,2,3

335VBRURDJCUNCHI5RUBRX8NZRI9EE,335VBRURDJCUNCHI5RUBRX8NZRI9EE, Simple community banking where everyone benefits and is primarily focused on providing financial services for those who need it most. First and foremost- the solution benefits those who are unable to access traditional banking accounts and services. Secondly- it benefits those who support such people to have better access to financial services (e.g.- the donors)- giving them knowledge that they are able to help fellow members of the community. It also allows such people to donate time in kind to staff with their ‘mobile’ banks. It also provides a forum for banks to support their local communities (and their CSR obligations). As per the description above- it’s the power of the community that propels the network. The solution can be built to start small: •A community bank (Bendigo Bank- Sydney AU) can be approached about diverting a percentage of its community funding to subsidise the cost of accounts and micro loans for a few people – a simple product with no charges or interest •Once successful- ‘traditional’ banking customers can directly donate money through a ‘keep the change’ approach •As a parallel activity of bringing the bank to the at-risk community members can be rolled out at any point Further insights and resources to aid in the refinement and implementation of the solution.

There will be two main players in this project - the community and the ambassador. The community will be given financial access through the ambassadors and they can approach them with ease for any questions or concerns instead of going to somewhere or someone distant to the community. The ambassador will be given incentives for their performance as access points for the community - they can sell bank accounts and also serve as teachers for their community. Through the ambassadors- the community members can easily open bank accounts for themselves and their families. Targeting areas with BanKO partner outlets or establishments- they can easily cash in and out of their accounts. They will be given access to different financial services such as cash in and out- purchase of airtime for a discounted rate- send money through their phones- pay utility bills- buy insurance- and apply for loans. BanKO can perform a pilot test in 2 areas in Metro Manila- Philippines - Quezon City and Las Pinas City. The company is targeting those communities since parent leaders were already contacted and the areas are near the head office of the company. They can easily be reached for any updates and can be easily gathered for any orientation or refresher sessions. BanKO is very open and willing to learn on how they can effectively educate the community leaders and members. Guidance in making the project more human-centered and more effective in replicating for different areas.

Our mission is to help millennials and young adults make smart money decisions. We have developed Napkin Finance as a quick and easy resource on everything you need to know about money in 30 seconds or less. It teaches readers how to take ownership of their personal finances and understand the power and impact behind making informed money decisions.Our platform helps organizations and financial institutions create a lifetime of financial well-being for their members and customers. Learning about finance can be intimidating and oftentimes overwhelming. The opportunity to create a lifetime of financial success is limited by the lack of access and skills.We partner with organizations that are working with young adults that may never otherwise have access to financial education. Napkin Finance has become a community of ideas and concepts that empowers readers to fully understand the complexity of personal finance. The Napkin Finance platform is simple and easy to understand- administer- and distribute. It can be tested in schools and with organizations that are working with young adults.We hope to evaluate the effectiveness of our finance literacy program on different age groups and skill sets.We are also working on a more interactive napkin with videos and clickable images. We are working with specialists and experts in various fields to develop our curriculum and content.From the OpenIDEO community- we would love feedback on the design- clarity- and usefulness of our current program.We would also welcome suggestions for additional topics and categories and how to make the platform more engaging.

Well-equipped kitchens and spaces go unused every day in NYC when restaurants close on certain days of the week. Meanwhile- there are a number of people selling homemade food items on the streets (i.e. tamales). If these micro-entrepreneurs can get access to use these unused spaces- they can grow their own output/profit- while restaurants can be paid for the space use through a profit/product share- gain community respect- & possibly incentivize workers to stay employed (if family works there). There would really leverage the core of the neighborhood -- neighbors giving each other a hand up. While logistical boundaries exist- this could blossom within the new sharing economy. This is an opportunity to create bridges between different ethnicities/cultures/communities- connecting restaurants to grow profits and expand menus- while educating individuals on growing a business. University students/city agencies could get involved -- developing business & financial planning skills. We'd have to go out and talk to both restaurants and the micro-entrepreneurs- and determine the boundaries of the businesses (time- resources- etc) as well as the interest of the mirco-entrepreneurs.

In addition- the bank members will get a debit card for their social accounts to facilitate donating and create a simplified connection to those needing funds within the current system & community. Members of the community are often encouraged to do good by seeing others do so. The idea is to give social community hubs- such as cafes- libraries- stores etc. accounts in the community bank or connect them back to the network so as to use them as an outlet for people to use the social card. While buying a coffee- they can use their card to quickly donate to any of the projects registered at the bank. Meanwhile- allowing others to see a simplified way of contributing within their own community A simple way is to create a sample of the social card and start using it within local community hubs and introduce it to the community. Thereby- you can test the communities reaction to the idea and their willingness to become part of the network whether as donor or receiver. It is also essential to test the banks willingness to set up such a network within their system- though it will not require their financial contribution- but merely their management. The idea allows for a lot of creative development and assessment. This includes ideas such as cafes creating their own account for people to put in money for free coffee for homeless people etc. It will also require input and further development as to how to integrate it within the financial system and back to the community.

378G7J1SJLA5Z8UQY2435HGYXS3EW9,378G7J1SJLA5Z8UQY2435HGYXS3EW9, Embed playgrounds with geometry lessons as a catalyst for independent thinking and empowerment Integrating geometric concepts into the design of playgrounds will produce a tangible and localized catalyst for learning. This idea assumes that we empower communities where education and financial independence remain stagnant. Young children may see the playground in one way as they play. Teenagers may model it with class geometry topics (flexible). Learning in an environment normally intended for play will help to make math concepts fun- relatable and transferable to other endeavors. The idea maintains focus on the design of ‘learning playgrounds.’ It also strives to create dexterity and engagement with a space- its learning and the community. For example- returning students could share their knowledge by explaining to younger kids how ‘learning playgrounds’ can and may have been applied in real life. Local communities could host class projects where students would be responsible for adding design features- class lessons or projects with the playground and its space etc. Kids familiar with geometry (grades 8-12) could be divided into groups. Each group would be given a limited amount of fluorescent colored duct tape. The exercise requires each group to build at least 4 different shapes on the playground. However- each shape can only be made with one color of tape. This exercise promotes critical thinking about space- resources- collaboration and the need to trade equal amounts of tape between groups in order to complete the assignment. (Hand outs encouraged) Child and learning development expertise. Other applications of the idea. Alternative materials. Playground designers. Risks or limitations associated with the exercise.

This idea benefits anyone who needs a good/service and has something else to exchange for it (apart from money). For the physical Flea Market it is necessary to have a space in the community (either block a street in partnership with governmental authorities or partner with a local school) and promote the activity to bring as many people as possible with its different offers (goods or services). For the online version it is needed a leader who will engageand moderate through a social network. This idea proves that it is possible to be financial independent by only exchanging resources already available in the community. It is a just a matter of creating a connection and learning how to leverage from each other's capabilities and possessions. To test the online Flea Market idea it is possible to pilot it within my facebook friends. I could create a facebook group to exchange goods and services and estimulate my friends to join and exchange among themselves. In that way I could see how much they like the idea and how it could be expanded and replicated. It would be great if OpenIDEO community members could also try this idea in their own friendship circles and share their experiences and feedback here. An individual,3,3,2,4,4
37M4O367VJU9YD7JJZ5DSP8UMXQM5P,37M4O367VJU9YD7JJZ5DSP8UMXQM5P, Philanthropy driven by those who receive funds. This idea will benefit grantees and the constituents they serve. Ultimately the grantee will be the active participant in the proposed structure- acting on behalf of their mission and who they serve. If the recipient of funding can help to determine funding design- type- recipients- and amounts- the philanthropic deployment of funds will more effectively leverage transformation. The community will be the grantor and the involvement of grantee leaders will create more interconnectedness within the impact sector. There have been applications of this model through a process called Shared Gifting. This process has been in application on a smaller scale for decades. More here: http://rsfsocialfinance.org/shared-gifting/ The barriers to creating this model on a larger scale is buy in from funders- likely foundations. The funding sources have their priorities and directives but if the paradigm can shift to one which releases direction of granting to the community- access to capital could stand to benefit from a more inclusive process. Granting is a standard process to the majority - those with funds decide where funds go (even if based on research or experiment). It will be hard to change this paradigm. An organization,3,3,2,4,3
37OPIVELUUFKC5IPNYGH8VGKXPSHAH,37OPIVELUUFKC5IPNYGH8VGKXPSHAH, I'd like to contribute this idea as a PR strategy for our sponsors to utilize. A. Beneficiaries - High school students and their families. It's well documented that financial behaviors start in the family. Like AA (alcoholic anonymous) those with in poor financial condition have a difficult time admitting to the problem. Role models- professional athletes- 'coming out' can have moving impact on others admitting to their current situation.B. Professional Athletes - Thought leaders for change- using their notoriety to give back and educate.C. Sponsors - PR strategy High schools already serve as educational facilitators for local communities. However- there is an issue with gaining enthusiasm around 'personal finance' seminars and classes because well... they're boring- AND more importantly no one wants to admit they are confused by their finances. Given their celebrity status in light of their own money problems- athletes have the power to change the stigma associated with personal finance by being advocates for classes sponsored by local high schools. 1. Have a professional athlete visit their high school to speak about his/her money problems as an equal with the student body and their parents in attendance.2. Have the professional athlete advocate for weekly/monthly class that is sponsored by the high school.3. If this works- scale the operation with more professional athletes across high more high schools and establish a universal curriculum. I have a question and a request. First the question: Do you think professional athletes as advocates for financial education actually have the ability to mobilize those who need it the most? Why or why not?The request: I am seeking our sponsors to help scale this potential campaign (if they see fit). Assuming of course this works in an experimental condition- professional athletes as advocates for better personal finance education has the ability to scale nationally (globally).

Existing property owners who already rent out part or all of their property could provide accommodation for free- as a form of (tax deductible?) donation to individuals and families needing short term accomodation and support following a personal/financial crises. This provides people with 'breathing space' in a safe environment to work out their financials and 'where to from here'. This taps into existing communities on site like Airbnb- private rental and couchsurfing sites. It focuses on close geographical communities (i.e. housing people from your own city) and could involve some kind of matching system so that property owners could support people of similar age- who have had a similar crises in the past etc. It could also be facilitated by charities/housing services to reduce risk and increase safety of both parties. Airbnb already offers something like this in the USA for people post a large natural disaster (e.g. Hurricane Sandy). This could be expanded to other countries and other accommodation sites. Input from people using sites like Airbnb as either a guest or a property owner.

It would benefit the immediate community these programs are located in. The main players are volunteers who would spend their time educating others of the concepts of financial responsibility. For example- they could go to high schools or community halls once a week to share their experiences- presenting real life examples rather than conceptual math classes. The volunteers would benefit because by teaching others- they would understand the material better as well as obtain new perspectives. The majority of the volunteers are ideally university students or professors (who are willing to dedicate their time to help others.) This may create a tighter network as each 'teacher' is trying to help someone in his/her community directly. In the long run- those who were initially learning could go on to become volunteers themselves in order to give back to their community- therefore creating a cycle that is constantly changing and evolving. Generation Citizen- a similar project in which volunteers go to local high schools to teach students about making a change in their community has seen some success in the east coast. Their core structure could act as a resource and a model that this new concept could follow. With GC's success in major cities such as Boston & Philadelphia- it does seem viable to assume that this concept could grow in big cities as well. It would be a great starting point if OpenIDEO could provide its network for the project. The first step would be to market what the project is and how it would work. Having a strong network will go a long way with a) getting the message to the public- b) obtaining the volunteers and gauging interest- and c) calculating if the project is feasible on a financial basis.

This program would benefit individuals who cannot oftain a convential loan product from a bank /CU (perhaps due to lack of credit or poor credit). It would also benefit individual's who are interested in taking on more investment risk for a potentially higher yield. Finally- this programs could benefit CUs who would provide the program backbone (ensuring lending compliance- providing required documents- etc) as the CUs would realize a new revenue stream from the small service fees imposed. Leverging the burgoening growd sourcing movement- this new platform would bring borrowers and investors together from accross the nation/world to provide the funds needed to those who may lack other alternatives. By creating a community where individuals can invest in each other and offer collateral or security that may be unconvential by traditional standards- it creates new opportunities for the underserved. Group funding helps spread the risk and increases the likelihood of a loan being made. Surveying individuals on the likelihood of lending money to various individuals based on varying scenarios and circumstances. This would provide an opportunity to test potential investors appetite for risk and willingness to contribute varying amounts at varying interest yields. This could also provide an opportunity to test the impact that social currency of helping out someone in need has on individual's sense of accomplishment and resulting desire to contribute. It takes a community to build a community so i'd seek the OpenIDEO community to provide feedback on what they would value most from such a program (as a borrower or investor). I would determine the value of social currency- poll users to get a feel for risk tolerance- acceptable collateral- what role the CU industry could play to create a secure and trustworthy community where transactions could occur.

3D3B8GE8923YK368E5AML97RDYK9PZ,3D3B8GE8923YK368E5AML97RDYK9PZ, Financial advisors are often too expensive for those most in need of their services. Let's connect community members with students! This idea benefits those in need and students studying financing. Those in need can receive financial advice at a considerable lower rate than what they might pay a financial advisor. College students can charge a small fee and benefit from the real world experience of advising their community members. This idea connects those who have deep financial knowledge with those who don't. It empowers the community by making financial guidance more accessible and empowers those in school by helping them refine their expertise. We could see how willing community members might be to receive financial advice from college students and how willing student might be to refine their expertise in the real world. We could also explore price points/subscription models that are acceptable by all involved. An OpenIDEO Meetup,4,4,3,4,4

This idea benefits the 46.5 million people who use the service provided by Feeding America. The whole idea is to teach them to be financially independent thus eventually reducing the number of people depending on food banks. The beneficiaries can multiply the money using ideas around financial literacy which can be taught through various media such as flyers- camps- programs- etc. The disadvantaged demographic uses the Feeding America network on a regular basis to fulfill their food requirements. Each community can raise the funds needed to support this program so that the government does not have to bear the costs of running this initiative. The community can also help provide options to the disadvantaged people on how to multiply the $10 that they will receive. We can pilot this program in a single food bank to understand the feasibility of this project. Providing $10 to each individual who uses that food bank service and check whether they are utilizing the $10 to multiply the same. We can choose the bank that has a tight-knit community that supports the bank so that we can help more people to become financially sustainable. It will be interesting for me to know whether anyone in this community has tried something similar. I would also like to get suggestions around using money as a tool to foster accountability. Currently food banks provide food for free- but do you think giving money first and asking an individual to just retain the money over a period of time can teach her financial literacy?

The app grows with your sprout This will help parents and children alike track their financial milestones - much like an app to ensure your child is accomplishing all of their developmental milestones. This app will allow users to keep there little sprouts on the right financial literacy track - not on track don't fret we have all the guides in place to connect you to the proper resources! Our challenge invites parents to come together as a community and share ideas- suggestions- what's working and more importantly what isn't. The app would provide forums searchable by key phrases such as how much does soccer camp cost? The app would grow with your sprout and connect parents by comparing their kids much like a development chart your child is in the 90th percentile for height and 60th percentile for weight. OpenIDEO Chicago could connect with a local school to review curriculum - what are kids REALLY learning about finical literacy? Once we obtain more information we would ask a verity of parents to attend an open forum night hosted by openIDEO - we would ask questions to better understand parental and child motivation for educating sprouts and what milestones they would be interested in their kids accomplishing. Ideally openIDEO Chicago would come up with a set of questions for other openIDEO communities to take to their local schools and/or parents. Do other regions- demographics- age groups want their children to learn different things or accomplish different goals? OpenIDEO Chicago would then synthesize the information and present it to the community in a concise format. An OpenIDEO Meetup,3,3,3,4,3

This idea generated from an article I read about the worth of the black woman. I was startled to know how many of us were not worth $5.However- for those that are in the lower level income bracket it becomes more crucial a task.So the demographics start with women who are making a living or less than a living wage and are still responsible for children. There are 1000s of organizations created to help women with getting jobs- financial literacy- and other issues that affect their lives.My approach is to teach them about savings and create a financial mechanism that will help them see the value of saving. The amount that I will ask for is $5.If I can reach 1-000-000 of us and show how $5 can grow I can inspire others to do the same. What I need is a mutual fund or bank that can help me run the program. Once I had the financial partner in place- I would be able to start with the Washington DC Metropolitan area with 100 women who are willing to invest in the fund. We would meet monthly- like an investment club- and watch the money grow. First- I need a financial partner who can advise me on creating the savings fund I envision. I would love to have partners who focus on women opportunities who can help me reach out to women and share the $5 Dollar Project.Everyone who believes in the idea is valuable as it could really change lives.

They will learn to be creative- entrepreneurial and financially responsible as they will gain a better understanding into the effort required to obtain compensation. This platform could work in all locations and demographics. The jobs would vary but the education taken from the experience would be life changing. Communities need a way for people to connect with one another beyond their immediate neighbors and offer up money making and financially educational opportunities to children or young adults so that they will learn these lessons earlier in life. The process would be to provide a platform for individuals to identify problems or jobs that are needed throughout the community. They would then approach the benefactor to negotiate a price for this service. From there the service could be provided. Gather our neighbors together and discuss the platform concept. We could then encourage the young people to seek out opportunities and begin to negotiate the importance and price of the service. This would help us better understand the needs of the platform before setting out on designing the solution to help facilitate the interaction. Feedback about how the solutions could be identified and captured. Testing the concept within different communities. Improving and iterations on the idea. Other,3,3,2,3,4

3FULMHZ7OU9R2U3J5UM3NX2GM1VM4K,3FULMHZ7OU9R2U3J5UM3NX2GM1VM4K, Each student would receive a salary based on performance- participation- and other school credentials to use for lunch and school store. This idea benefits the world because if young kids are educated about how to spend their money; they directly impact the future of our economy. The users would be parents- teachers- school employees- and the students- of course. This is targeting kids from K to 5th grade. The teachers would have to plan a system on the salary for each student and what are the factors that play into it. I think we could start in the public schools in Chicago or another big public school network. This idea is leveraging the family communities in big cities to bring together their kids- teachers- and parents. Usually kids learn about handling money in high school and by that point- it is too late because there will always be a divide in the financial health of each household. By learning the value of a dollar early on- the kids will gain insight on how to spend their money- what their needs are vs. their wants- and how to treat others equally. I could go to my old middle school or elementary school and try to test this idea out in one class. I could work with the teacher and the parents to come up with a salary system. Then the kids could just buy things during class and then we came move further to lunch or the school store. I need help to come up with a structured plan around this idea. When I was younger- I went to a children's museum in Chicago where there was a fake grocery store and I could pick out the things I wanted and go to the cashier. I had a limit based on the fake money I had. I want to emulate the same kind of experience every day for kids because it made the experience of money super fun!! An OpenIDEO Meetup,2,2,2,2,3

This idea can assist many communities- from kids learning the importance of saving money for a rainy day or adults with bad financial habits. This concept allows for users to sympathize with their digital pets needs. The more you save the better healthier your pet will be. Our challenge focus on digital communities- we plan to focus our efforts on digital tacking- forums and comparisons. If your family is saving for a vacation- you can create a family pet. See who contributes more - the competitive nature might nourish some unexpected results. OpenIDEO Chicago would test a variety of user groups to see who is the best target market- as of know we know that kids enjoy and become addicted to games quickly. However with some thought- we also realize that teens and adults greatly enjoy games such as angry birds. Could we streamline the experience to fit a variety of folks. Make it harder to keep you pet alive as you grow older and make more money. We would love for ideas and observations from the openIDEO community. What challenges could we set in place to make the game more interesting - can we link the app to peoples bank and credit accounts? An OpenIDEO Meetup,4,4,4,4,4

This idea benefits the direct community as a whole- which could potentially bring them together to help build- the players are the community. This idea would see communities build their wealth- infrastructure etc. together. By being able to directly contribute- whether it be through money- time- manual labour or materials and then harnessing the ideas each community has to improve their local areas. This would assist in building much needed basic resources- which in turn would allow the community to concentrate on other areas for furtherdevelopment. I think this is already a work in practice for certain communities- for example the Amish- from my basic understanding they are essentially a self sufficient community that grow and build resources together. The flaw I can see in this idea is the politics surrounding the appropriation of funds and being able to minimize corruption.

This target audience is people who have been declined for a loan & are: Already engaged with the credit union & possibly a member Motivated to learn behavior that will put them in position to borrow Need something the credit union has (a loan)This solution makes CU impact on several levels: This is in keeping with a core value of the CU industry – to educate and enrich. CUs are able to turn declines into borrowers increasing profitability Impact can be measured definitively The credit union community is made up of 6400 CUs and 98 million members. The industry generates hundreds of declines for loan applications (mortgage- auto and unsecured) daily. Currently our community is offering a free credit report to declined would-be borrowers- but not much more. The end user for this idea (the would-be borrower) is arguably a person who needs financial education the most- is coming to the CU community for a solution. I lead a team of financial literacy specialists at Patelco Credit Union (one of the larger CUs in the US).

Making information transparent and connecting people will ultimately strengthen communities and local business- specifically financial services because they'll be able to gather realtime data they've never had access to before helping them development new services and programs geared to reach specific end users. We'll allow them a way to maintain a monthly dialog with users to help them stay on the path. What the founder of Tactile Finance learned about the real estate and banking industries isn't even the half of it. I think real estate more than banking prefers it's customers with as little info as possible. Most real estate companies are more worried about their bottom line than building sustainable communities. They ignore the part of housing- residential rentals- where most low-middle incomers dwell. And where the most support is needed for property owners to reduce risk so capital flows. I was able to discuss with a community bank- how they could get better and more info on renters from the property owners they finance. They only make multifamily loans and the gov't wants to make sure the funds are really improving communities. I did classes at the CHA on sustainable communities for a year and talked to countless owners renting to low income people on housing assistance vouchers. And I operated a property management company for 10 years- I understand how to help this market. http://firstround.com/review/Dropboxs-Head-of-Design-on-the-Dawn-of-Personalized-Products/ I initially thought we had a ux designer but have discovered I was mistaken so I still need help there and also looking for a dynamic programmer.

This idea could benefit anyone with savings that wants to be better informed about how to manage their money. Once you start doing some research about where to place your savings you realize you have to be concerned about inflation- high fees- interest rates- etc. Automated investment services such as Betterment offer an easier way to invest- but these tools are not entirely transparent. This idea is for savers who want to build some basic financial skills but don't know where to begin. Today- robo-advisors supply online investment management and financial advice through desktop platforms and mobile apps. This idea is leveraging the infrastructure of this existing system- using it as a medium to incite intrigue and furnish detailed information explaining metrics and jargon. Lightweight prototypes could be made using spreadsheet programs such as Excel or Numbers. The success and presence of current tools; for example- automated investment services or robo-advisors such as Betterment and Wealthfront- is an indicator of the potential for this idea.

The main customers would be teenagers who play sports as a form of hanging out with friends. Teenagers are an important demographic because they most likely don't generate income but are spending carelessly. The suppliers of the vending machines can include Mastercard which wants to educate teenagers on credit cards or a nonprofit which wants to impart knowledge on global poverty. Teenagers don't have many viable options when hanging out with friends. Specifically in low-income areas- teenagers are heavily influenced by sports or music. This solution plays (pun intended!) on the mere-exposure effect and a community's love for sports . While the vending machines will make playing sports more easily accessible- they will also keep children off the streets while exposing them unknowingly to small nuggets of financial information. Our minds are trained to rule out going to the park if we don't have a ball with us so it will take unlearning and relearning for people to learn and remember that a certain park rents balls. Do you think this habit can be changed? -What are some ways to ensure the rented balls are returned to the machine given that we can't hold IDs or other forms of authentication? Or can the vending machines be designed to ensure this behavior? -How difficult and costly would maintenance be for the vending machine and balls? An individual,3,3,2,2,4

This idea benefits people who might be too embarrassed to speak about their financial situation with others. It gives them a social platform to voice their concerns while remaining anonymous. Each person would write their money issue on a mask and wear it at the event. Money Masquerades would be led by financial advisors who would consult and moderate open conversations between people. At the end of the event- people could optionally reveal their true selves—there's nothing to hide- afterall.

Social media sites are used by people worldwide. They are built on the idea of sharing and are act as virtual water coolers. They also appeal to our pride. We would help people become financially literate. We could partner with others (e.g.- MOOCs- finance experts) to ensure information is accurate and actionable. We could develop literacy training with progress broadcast through quizzes- certificates of completion- badges- etc. that would incentivize their network to do the same. On social media platforms- we build the community ourselves with people who share common interests. We are therefore inclined to trust and be influenced based on what others’ post. We can be highly specific so our message reaches people who need it most. We would provide a virtual community and help them get connected to other people and resources in their physical community. And by its very nature- we would encourage people to share their new knowledge with others through word of mouth. We could draft an online test to gauge people’s financial literacy and their desire to learn. We could distribute through advertisements on Facebook and Google based on their profiles and searches. Their feedback would tell us whether we need to reach people online- offline or both; whether we need to partner with organizations to develop a course or certification; whether they want to learn by reading- watching or listening. I want to know if you think social media campaign would work. If you think buying ads and having sponsored posts affects the credibility of the informaiton.

The attendees will benefit from supportive- flexible- affordable- and personal learning program while the leader receive incentive- develop network- experience and skills. It allows the less fortunate to monetize skills they have much more easily. Such model can be more attractive for business and organization to sponsor given its measurable impacts. Community Guideline is critical for a community to thrive. We propose new guideline that can be easily adopted in existing community structures- systems and values. The guideline brings recommended practices of effective group building through optimum number of participants- catalyze trust and bonding through repeat interactions- yet limit commitment needed. It incorporate money as incentives and create new financial opportunities by sharing skills - ultimately create new skill-based marketplace A local meetups can be organized based on approaches mentioned above- featuring a mentor on basic financial management. The goal of the experiment is to invite- get participants to pay- attend all 3 sessions and satisfy the learning objectives.Some questions: - Should we pay at each session? as lump sum for all sessions at the beginning or at the end? - Should we make a bigger group with lower fees or small group with higher fees?- Should we use money or tokens?

Anyone that uses a smartphone and is interested in opportunities for more successful financial management could engage with this tool. Access to traditional financial services is not a requirement; the app can help manage spending for anyone that users payment systems that are connected digitally - traditional banks- Paypal- digital currencies- etc. A key element of this tool is the ability to use community benchmarks to better understand spending patterns- and share spending/saving behaviors with others in your network. We believe that opportunities to make anonymous comparisons with other people in similar situations and share positive financial behaviors openly within your network spread knowledge and encourage positive decisions. There are opportunities to test the contextually relevant budget capability using a behavioral test at a local grocery store - participants would be presented with budget information and details on their past spending as they enter the store- and a follow-up interview would assess the impact on their spending. Similar small prototypes could be created to test the impact of personalized rewards (iTunes/Netflix) on weekly spending as well as benefits associated with social budgeting/benchmarking. It would be great to receive input across a few key questions - What causes individuals to loose track of their budget?- What are locations when it would be helpful to receive advice/information about your spending?- What are other incentives beyond iTunes/Netflix that users would want to receive daily/weekly/monthly as a reward for positive spending behavior?

The idea is not centered on abilities- but on spending experiences and community expertise. The network of producers and shop owners can narrow the spendings for a category down and with financial support from sponsors even beyond the usual spendings. A lot of expenses are not structured- for example when I analyse that during one year most of the expenses for traffic happen because of a defect part. The idea would be to analyse and then using the community to act better and fairer. Companies- shop owners and production facilites can be asked what they are able to provide. Production facilites can provide parts- shop owners special services and the team must solve the problem- how such a small ecosystem could raise the necessary attention- stay attractive as well as financial able to guarantee a good service. I am interested if a similar project already exist- for example for a single product or category and what other transaction methods can be used for such an idea. An individual,3,3,3,4,3

For almost every college- there is a group of dedicated college alumni who donate to the college- interview perspective students- and are willing to talk with students about their careers. Those alumni who experienced the difficulties of being first generation college students would likely be willing to reach out to first generation students now- to help them manage the tribulations- temptations- and expense of college life. As a 1st gen alum living near my alma mater (and now in business school there)- I will talk to my university about the potential of this idea. An individual,3,3,4,4,3

The target market would be the young adults (age 14-20) that are entering into the “real” financial world. The immediate benefit of the plan is to give access to using a cell phone based on correctly answering a finance question. Long term the knowledge gained through the learning games will provide for better financial understanding. Local financial institutions can provide incentives to active accounts within their Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The community financial institutions that work with app development as financial sponsors are benefiting as well by gaining access to new clientele that are financially savvy. Focus group in a local school with students and parents would provide for proof of concept. Phone app development would be the most helpful. The development of the User Interface (UI) is a bit beyond me- but I can provide basis for financial questions. Other,4,4,4,3,4
3PR3LXCWSFB3TC8Z0WK3FMTUFXT9XN,3PR3LXCWSFB3TC8Z0WK3FMTUFXT9XN, Rounding up your purchases to empower people around the world. This program is for anyone with a credit/debit card from ages 8-88- from anywhere around the world. They can enroll in the program if they wish to set aside money every month for the purposes of empowerment and alleviating poverty. On the other end- the borrowers of the money will have the power to create opportunities for themselves- whether through launching a small business or funding their education. The idea suits the opportunity by connecting people through donating to empowerment opportunities- where the borrower will return the money with interest to a community pool of money or microfinance institution. Additionally- that pool of money can be used in that community to further fund other empowerment opportunities and develop the economy. We can create a keep the change mechanism for a group of friends who may need money in times of emergencies. For example- with people who are paying cash- we can ask them to keep the change to put aside for donations to a specific person's empowerment opportunity. Say your friend at school needs to borrow $10 from you to urgently purchase school supplies for her next assignment. She will then return the money- with interest- to a pool of money for all further opportunities that may arise. Should the accumulated change (on average $20) be donated directly to the empowerment opportunity (through a web-based platform like Kiva Zip)? Or directly to a microfinance institution? Should the lending pool of money be focused on that community or go back to a world wide audience?How might we get the person donating the change to feel more connected to the borrower and community they are helping to empower?

3QGHA0EA0JC7S5I6OB2D49ADUVQBW6,3QGHA0EA0JC7S5I6OB2D49ADUVQBW6, Could reduction of pay inequality help build trust and subsequently empower those of lower economic class? This idea could primarily benefit people who are disenfranchised by the current levels of income disparity (at least from a U.S. perspective).I do believe that everyone could potentially benefit from this idea. By defining- and building- communities that include all economic classes I believe we can build trust (in both directions) between those who have financial knowledge and power and those who are more or less disenfranchised by current structures. Ben & Jerry's is one example of a company that tried to limit the ratio in pay between the highest paid employee and the lowest- but unfortunately that practice didn't survive the sale of the company.Other than seeking out other examples- I have to acknowledge that I'm not sure of a lightweight test. I think it would be important to try to quantify what would constitute an ideal amount of pay inequality and what the tradeoffs might be- if that can be done via appropriate research.I would also welcome ideas on how to facilitate building community and networks between high and low earners.

They end up collecting life-long low-wage checks instead of fixing the root cause and changing their habits or gaining knowledge.The other main player would be the employer who provides the training. If the programs are optional- the attendance rate would not be as high as if the class was held during paid work time. (Benefits listed in next answer) You are who you surround yourself with. Low-wage hires are spending a lot of time with others just like them who have the same mentality and habits. Financial training that is designed to be actionable can change the sentiment of the workplace. Hires will feel 1) accompanied by their colleagues- 2) that their employers care despite the low wages and 3) empowerment to change. The shift in mentality may lead to higher productivity from the hires than the cost of paying for the hour of training. One way to test the idea can be to gauge interest by putting postings of financial trainings that are held during hires' off-hours. -What would be the potential cost for a company such as Walmart to implement this training? -How difficult would it be for a company to be willing to implement this training? -Is in-person training the most effective platform?

3T8DUCXY0NIWCVZFVMJ6QJ8O2159T4,3T8DUCXY0NIWCVZFVMJ6QJ8O2159T4, What if every social enterprise pledged to hire one man or woman in need for a year program? We want to create a platform that makes it easy These programs will benefitwomen and men who have just graduated from job ready programs through other non profit organizations and can't find jobs. Social enterprises should act as a stepping stone and help introduce them to a traditional workforce. They will be able to learn the skills they need to excel their financial and working knowledge. Social enterprises will also be able to asses their individual strengths for jobs in the future. There will be room for expansion in the private sector This idea specifically uses the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources because job experience is crucial in achieving both. As a community it is a small responsibility that everyone can take to change someones life. Organizations like the Downtown Women's Center and Chrysalis do a great job in providing job training and resume building but not every student that graduates from their programs wants to do the work that they have. Everyone has a different dream job. We could survey surrounding small business and social enterprises to see if they would be willing to take on one new employee and for what time frame? is one year too long? how much would they be able to pay them? is a mentorship a few days a week more likely? SOWN is a social enterprise that wants to do this work and not make social enterprises the dichotomy of earning money from one thing- and funneling it to the next. We want to practice what we preach and give women first hand experience. We want to create a program so that it is easy for every social enterprise to hire on or mentor a man or woman in need. It shouldn't be a burden but a joy to give someone the opportunity to learn the skills and open up new financial opportunities and resources. Personal financial tips that you've grown up learning would be so valuable. We would be seeking expertise from the OpenIDEO community in how to create this platform and how to give these women the best tools to move forward. A student project or collaboration,2,2,3,4,3
3TFJJUELSH14QUC5OR91RM0689VC2W,3TFJJUELSH14QUC5OR91RM0689VC2W, Scaling up BRAC's graduation model for the poorest : build an inclusive social network while introducing basic entrepreneurship training This idea benefits the ultra poor. People living below 1.25$ a day are not an homogeneous pool and a unique set ofintervention is required for those in the lowest half of the group who live on 60 to 70 cents a day or less- eat below 80% of their energy requirements despite spending at least 80% of their income on food. The main players would be microfinance institutions who want to extend their reach. This idea use existing structures such as NGOs or microfinance institutions to target the ultra poor and provide grants of productive assets (like livestock) as well as weekly stipends. The aim is to provide breathing room while they learn new livelihoods. The second step is then to encourage participants to save money while providing intensive hands-on training. Itmobilize community to integrate the ultra poor and give them the needed confidence boost. BRAC already runned extensive research about this model- and has demonstrated the success of this scalable- household-to-household approach. Indeed- 75 to98% of participants met the graduation criteria. Evidence also suggests the approach can work outside BRAC's native Bangladesh.

I think this idea can benefit people who don't want to spend much time or energy trying to be a finance literate. This will make learning financial literacy fun!! Each of us have an obsession or weakness for something. For some it is shoes- for some it is gadgets or books etc. How about which translate all the financial terms into those terms. Say- Person A likes to buy a lot of shoes. So we translate terms like funds- savings- investing - learning how money works in terms of number shoes he/she can buy or is equal to.A mobile application can be built to do this.

This concept would benefit the user by allowing them to navigate those difficult life decisions (specifically financial decisions) in a simulated real-world environment. The main players would be; for example- a large gaming publisher such as Electronic Arts and a reputable financial software provider such as Mint. This could pose an opportunity for these businesses to expand into new markets by providing educational products. A Life Sim gaming environment uses the power of community in two ways. First- in the sense that it takes the strengths of specialists from the gaming industry and the financial software industry to deliver a new product that combines a simulated environment and professional financial advice. Second being the community of virtual people or Sims with whom your avatar would interact and play out scenarios. The quickest and least involved method to get a bearing on the viability of this concept would be to conduct interviews in local communities. Statistics indicate that there is a potential market. By 2013- Electronic Arts had sold 175 million units since introducing The SIMS in 2000. In 2012 Mint topped 10 million registered users. A.

3UEDKCTP9V2TVTLZMG7UBWUMOYQK7X,3UEDKCTP9V2TVTLZMG7UBWUMOYQK7X, Invest in the next generation by pledging money towards students' college funds. The idea benefits students in grades K-12 who need empowerment most. The idea of Marathon Learning encompasses a platform where students can create a personalized profile in which individuals in their network and beyond can pledge money towards their college tuition in exchange for earning good grades. Students from all types of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds could benefit from this idea with the promise that their achievements will be compensated with money towards higher education. This idea would work similarly to how donors pledge money for miles a runner completes in a marathon—in this case the student's existing community is pledging money towards a number of pre-prescribed grades earned (whether those grades are As- Bs- or Cs depends on the specific student). Marathon Learning uses the untapped potential of the student's social network to further their education- and thus allows more students from low-income communities to become financially empowered through school. To test this idea- I could use a high school student in my own network (ex. my 16 year old sister). I would have this student create a private Facebook page that highlights official academic progress- accomplishments- and goals. Then- I would have this student reach out to adults and financially able individuals within their community and social network asking for pledges of money to fund college in exchange for specific grades earned in the next academic semester. I would need help programming this funding platform. I would also need help in ideating on the logistics of collaborating with schools. The platform involves ensuring that the student's grades reported are official according to his/her transcript- that the money pledged goes to a secure source used specifically for college- and that students cannot see each other's profiles.

The main beneficiary is poor families who are at risk of buying unhealthy foods to sate short term hunger. Better food saves health (and money) long-term.Grocers benefit when these customers buy higher-margin foods. They promote the program and provide infrastructure to track purchases.Insurers benefit from customers with improved long-term health- and reduced claims. They will pay forward incentives in an interest-bearing bank account for participants.Banks benefit from new users! Each of these stakeholders -- shoppers- grocers- health insurers- and banks -- plays an integral role in the community. There livelihoods depend on one another. Although the symbiotic nature of their relationships has been short-circuited in many communities- we believe this idea can rewire the circuitry. Every actor is incentivized not only to participate- but also to encourage the participation of others. The greater the involvement- the greater the benefit for each who is involved. The challenge will be to broker the initial partnerships and bridge the gaps of confidence that exist. Will a banker sign on? Sure- but only if they know the insurer will. But the insurer will only agree once the grocer has signaled long-term commitment. And so on. Early experiments would need to involve lots of discussion with each stakeholder. Not only will this help identify key concerns- but it will also engage their thinking in the process before it even begins. Talk to your grocer! Health insurers – what data exist that link healthy eating with reduction in diabetes- heart disease- cancer?Banks – what regulatory hurdles stand in the way of partnerships like this? What impediments do you have to linking reward systems with other vendors?Grocers- food manufacturers – could this type of program integrate with your existing rewards programs?

This idea not only helps to transform the traditional attitudes among women but also do benefits to the whole society once women could become economic independent.The main player here is the dominance of the women in econmic position. When the women become economic independent- the whole communities could create more work opportunies - resources- and even develop quickly. In Chinese history- the position of women might be lower than men's as the traditional attitudes towards economic independence. However- the perspectives have changed graduallyandwomen become more and more independent especially in the economic aspect even some women may be more powerful in the economic position than men. And the whole society develops quite dramatically with the financial independence of women. Therefore- I think this could be helpful to the community in any other counties. change traditional attitudes between men and women in financial position could be the key to arrange this thoughts.

3W0XM68YZP7FK76XX0QLAM39LCQK10,3W0XM68YZP7FK76XX0QLAM39LCQK10, Transformation from downward spiral of debt trap to upward path of financial inclusion using data analysis At the core of it- the idea benefits MSMEs (ex: small holder farmer in Indonesia - referred as Taman) in emerging markets. Taman is farmer in Indonesia who does not have access to credit. But it will also create value for financial institutions (MFIs and Commercial Banks) and the Government. MSMEs will get loans and saving tools faster- easier and cheaper. Profitability of MFIs would be improved up to 5 times and the Government will be able to meet development targets. TRUST- is a major adoption barrier in the whole process. and close second is education. The idea will use informal networks of the community- informal data exchanged in the community and the existing trust between community member to develop and deliver the solution. Consider small holder farmers in Indonesia- they have community based solutions for agri-info and financial support. But there are ways to improve existing model to achieve scale and impact using data present in current model. An application prototype would be build to deliver on envisioned experience map for accessing financial services. This app would be used to help each stakeholder experience the solution. Farmers will be asked to give information required for solution and key assumption can be tested. The feedback would be incorporated to refine it further leading to a product tailored to specific needs. Providing The existing users of current model can be provided services to test the efficacy of the solution. I believe the solution to promote financial inclusion varies by community. There are a lot of informal models to doing daily activities that vary from community to community. Communities within a country are closely linked- but again vary by current work industry. A better understanding of the needs of farmers and MFIs would in refining the solution further. An individual,1,1,1,1,1

Their educational level and employment rate is significantly lower in comparison to the national average. Age rage is from 18-62 years. Focus will be given to financial empowerment of Roma women. Also beneficiaries will be young Roma and non-Roma students and financial institutions included in design of the new tool and its implementation. The idea will use power of young Roma and non-Roma student graduates (IT- finance- economics and social sciences)- representatives from financial institutions and direct Roma beneficiaries who will be joint to work together with community Coaches and Mentors in design and development a whole new set of services and tools that will ease access of Roma to financial institutions and resources. The tool will be designed by students- financial institutions experts- community coaches and mentors- and Roma clients in one of the largest Roma communities in the countryTopaana located in country capital Skopje and then the prototype can be tried out in 4 municipalities with highest % of Roma inhabitants in the country (municipalities of Suto Orizari- Chair (Topaana)- Tetovo and Kumanovo) to find out if the proposed manner of support will meet out expectations. OpenIDEO support is needed to identify new innovative ways to revive the traditional channels of communication- such as face-to-face and telephone communications—that are widespread in the Roma community- by adding new features that will make the distribution of information or access to advice more effective and accessible for Roma.

3Z56AA6EK4C5HH7XOIFIKVMUIS1M65,3Z56AA6EK4C5HH7XOIFIKVMUIS1M65, The dollar sign is often used to connote price: the more $s- the bigger the price tag. Let's rethink how we communicate value and costs. This idea benefits all shoppers and service providers. Similar to movie ratings that have guidelines enforcing their correct application- the dollar sign- from $-$$$$ (or perhaps we create new icons) could more expressively differentiate products and services based on their true cost and value. Shoppers can make smarter purchasing decisions when they understand why something costs what it does and what value it has. Services can better differentiate their offerings beyond price point. Film ratings influence movie releases and audience attraction which influences film production by movie houses. An audience's reaction to a simple but differentiating PG or R rating can determine what is bought into and what isn't. Leveraging communities in a similar fashion by making the $ a greater symbol of service/product cost and value not only better helps people understand the true quality of what they are buying- it could also shape that quality over time. We could speak with community members to gain a greater understanding of what $- $$- $$$- and $$$$ means to people. We could also explore different icons to see what visual cues communicate cost and value best. An OpenIDEO Meetup,2,2,2,2,4

Our idea is about tapping into the God-given potential of youth volunteers to empower other youth aged between 16 and 24 in urban areas in Kinshasa and small holders in rural areas neighboring Kinshasa- focusing on young girls and women- to become literate on financial matters and have the opportunity to get access to credit in order to make their livelihoods better through a better management of small businesses and social entrepreneurship. The initiative will harness the power youth volunteers to empower their communities towards financial inclusion through training and creating opportunities for bettering their livelihoods. The first step towards achieving this will be to partner with financial institutions like FINCA International- and UN specialized agencies- like UNCDF- which will provide us with the necessary tools to organize a training of trainers. We will conduct surveys in schools- churches- universities- and a neighboring small town near Kinshasa- to determine the needs for young people- small business holders- and young girls and women- for financial inclusion. The second step will be to organize a training of trainers- in partnership with FINCA and UNCDF. We will select a group of youth volunteers from among the Bridge volunteers- and train them on financial literacy as well as methods of financial inclusion. We might be seeking guidance from the OpenIDEO community on the right research questions to ask to our users during our surveys- and better refine our idea. An organization,2,2,3,3,3
