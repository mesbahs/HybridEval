The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm A student collaboration An Individual</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Embodied Labs creates immersive virtual reality experiences that allow family care partners to embody a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile.</p>","3","VR use might increase over time.

To ensure that the Therapal adds value to caregiving experience- we interview caregivers when developing new features- and then cycle-through the user testing process with individuals memory disorders. We can watch the emotions of users- gauging how the Therapal makes them feel when it is introduced to them- and when it responds with a friendly purr.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We are always looking for unique input from present- past- and future caregivers. Whether you are a grandchild or a neighbor of someone with a memory disorder- you know how much the disorder can change the daily life of that individual. We aim to improve the physical and mental well being of everyone involved in the caregiving experience. If you identify as a caregiver and believe Therapalz can make your experience easier- reach out to us at Therapalz@gmail.com and on social media @Therapalz.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>The Therapalz team has experienced the difficulties of caregiving firsthand- watching our grandparents develop memory disorders and move out of their homes and into nursing care facilities.

Updated 12/26: Deck- Prototype- and Videos: 1.Story. 2.Caregiver Insights.</h2><p>AI-powered tele-exercise live video platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected and active- and build healthy habits in a fun way.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our idea is designed for caregivers taking care of a loved one with early and mid-stage dementia. My mother- at age 72- became my caregiver while I was fighting stage IV cancer. During this difficult time- I felt guilty that I made her age a lot- and today I worry more about her as she turns 77- especially recently when I had to take her to the ER and she became hospitalized. This dynamic role shift has enabled me to see how scary and stressful caregiving can be.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We conducted >100 interviews and tested our product in elder centers across SF. Our research revealed two most popular activities in elder centers. 1. music and dance- and 2. cross-generation activities. We are applying for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community fund with two local non-profits to set up a cross-generation program. University AME Zion Church is the oldest African American church in Palo Alto- already offer tech education program. InATalent brings teenagers to dance with seniors.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We were amazed by the data in the design brief- especially the personas provided by IDEO.org- and the journey map provided by AgingWellHub. We are excited to see countless great ideas submitted to the site and already see opportunities for potential collaboration. We are grateful that our favorite company- IDEO- has a similar focus that is so close to our heart. We look forward to benefitting from OpenIDEO’s incredible resources and using them to build out and refine our idea.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>I have an extensive background in human-centered design for brands like Yahoo- AT&T- VW- and Sony. Stage IV cancer pushed me to dedicate my life to innovate and improve both patient and caregiver experience. I was also trained in social entrepreneurship at Stanford and Singularity University.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Caregiving can be very stressful. Dance4Healing is an AI-powered tele-exercise platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected- increase accessibility to group exercise- and build healthy habits in a fun way. Our mission is to reduce caregivers’ stress- combat isolation- and improve both emotional and physical health by bringing dance- community- and cross-generational support to home care.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Dance4Healing is designed for accessibility with a tiered model. Our target customers are Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly- Medicare Advantage Plans- and Elder Centers. The basic platform with 40 pre-recorded dance videos is $250/month/location. Caregivers can access the platform at elder centers or from home with no charge. Customized content can be created based on their preference to increase engagement. All the programs only need a computer- wifi- and willing participants!</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We are working with OnLok to launch a program designed to reduce anxiety and depression for dementia patients and caregivers. We plan to scale to 233 PACE centers nationwide- serving over 40-000 participants. OnLok founded PACE for the government and is internationally recognized as an eldercare leader. PACE also relieves the burden of caregivers by offering breaks that enable them to better focus on their mental and physical health- and allowing them to spend more time with their families.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Impact will be measured by tracking how many classes caregivers attend- how long they dance- which videos they use- and how they feel before and afterwards. Sensor tracking will be implemented via partnership. Clinical measurements like Zarit Burden Scale Short and CESD-10 has been recommended by our clinical partner- Stanford professor Dolores Thompson- expert on reduce stress- anxiety and depression for dementia family caregivers- a 25 year Geropsychologist and NIH funded researcher.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our next steps are working with partners and potential funders. 1. OnLok- launch an anxiety and depression reduction program for dementia patients/caregivers. 2. Avenidas- start test the program at their centers. 3. RWJF: advised by program officer Michael Painter to apply for pioneer grant. 4. Moore Foundation: encouraged by President Harvey Fineberg to apply for community health grant. 5. Chan Zuckerberg Fund- launch an intergenerational program pending the result of our grant application.</p>","3","It has some tough competition to stay viable.","How does this idea differentiate themselves from Just Dance? And how will it justify it costs? What does the AI?I think the research is pretty interesting with the dance/music and cross-gen activities. Though I don't see cross-gen activities back in the idea. I want to know how exactly this idea will strengthen bonds.","Product is definitely feasible, but the costs of 250$ per month is very expensive.

The report finds caregivers on average spend $7-000 on caregiving per year- which goes toward paying for personal- medical and household needs. While Alzheimer’s/dementia caregivers spend- on average- 54% more. Genivity helps caregivers understand and plan early for care costs to help protect their financial future.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>While many aspects of caregiving have been previously studied- financial caregiving remains largely unexamined. We are currently working with financial advisors who are interested in providing caregiving and care planning solutions to their clients. We want to more closely track results from these planning conversations to show how this risk information helps caregivers save more today for retirement so their own care needs will be covered after caregiving.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Feedback on our caregiver experience and help with how to display care cost and disability information in a sensitive yet educational way to families.

Education is provided through an e-learning component and cognitive feedback offered during the scenario-based serious game. Additionally- the scenario-based tool offers a safe- virtual environment where caregivers can test coping strategies and experience the implications of their actions in realistic and recognizable scenarios.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>This idea has already been evaluated through several focus groups of caregivers of individuals with dementia in Flanders- Belgium and was also evaluated by several clinicians as part of a masters thesis at the University of Leuven in Belgium. These initial focus groups provided excellent input from the target audience into the needs and expectations for such a tool. Additional focus groups could also be carried out in other jurisdictions where the company operates- such as North America.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>The most interesting input from the OpenIDEO community would be related to how can we bring this evidence-based educational tool from demo stage to the market.

All content has been derived from scientific literature and validated with experts. The serious game has been tested in four focus groups of informal caregivers. Dementia stakeholders in Belgium have confirmed the need of such a tool.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We expect that MIB Coping Dementia will be provided to end users at no- or minimal- cost. Our intention is to license the tool to regional dementia patient and caregiver networks focusing on established family groups. Two elements that will facilitate this is the low barrier for moderators and the forthcoming online accessibility. This will ensure that MIB Coping Dementia is accessible to all those that wish to attend an in-person session or use it independently at home.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We have a clear plan for scalability in Flanders- which will serve as proof-of-concept for other regions. As dementia advocacy and support groups operate at regional levels- we will focus on marketing MIB Coping Dementia to regional groups such as Alzheimer's Society- Alzheimer's Association- etc. We have well-established connections with such groups outside of Belgium and plan to move into new European countries each year starting in 2019. We will initiate a simultaneous plan for North America.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>The impact of our idea can be measured at a personal level by integrating questionnaires into the tool and analyzing outcomes over time. Alternatively it could be measured at the regional level by evaluating pooled user data such as: number of users- times accessed- outcomes- etc.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our immediate next steps are to finalize the e-learning and integrate the package into an online environment.

Patients are connected with their families through a personalized music device and mobile application. The device is used by the patient and managed by their family members or caregivers through the app. When the patient does not remember a face- a sound is used in place to “remind” the user and trigger memories.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have evidence that proves the concept could work for some and we want to dedicate more time to using music to try to awaken memories with individuals across various stages of Alzheimer's- and together with caregivers and at nursing homes. We also feel the design of both the app and tangible music player needs to be refined for both the caregiver and person living with Alzheimer's respectively- therefore we would continue crafting and testing mockups and prototypes until it's good enough.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We'd appreciate any help that gets us closer to not only bringing this project to life- but improves the system and experience we are proposing. We'd also love to hear about the community's experience providing care with the help of music. Also we're eager to find technologies that can enable the seamless interaction between the people and the music at just the right moment.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Two of us are Interaction Designers at different tech companies and two are Industrial Designers working at design consultancies. We all graduated together from Umeå Institute of Design a few years ago. We have diverse professional backgrounds between us- including work in healthcare and wellness.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>It is a digital music player and application designed for people with Alzheimer's.Along with the well-known benefits of music- their songs help them remember who they are- but there wasn't a music player on the market that has been designed for their specific needs. So we designed one- along with a platform for caregivers so that they can manage the music library and music therapy.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Throughout our design process we have prioritized solving usability issues that people face- such as loss of dexterity- poor vision- etc. Concerning accessibility in terms of cost- organizations such as Music and Memory are dedicated to the efforts of sourcing and distributing mp3 players- as well as recruiting volunteers. We aim to keep our price below the ones they currently use- to make our Remind system an opportunity for everyone.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Remind is a system that includes both a device and software- but we plan to design a version of the ios and android app that can be used without our music player- but instead using existing personal devices- speakers- and headphones. The concept can not include some of the features but will be scalable as long as there is music. We will educate people on how to use it through the website.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>By observing people use it- as well as feedback- stories from caregivers and nursing home workers on their experiences using the music system with their care-recipient. Since this an emotional topic- we want to provide a space for users to share the success and challenges they have in an open forum- to help them help each other strengthen their relationships while spreading awareness of Remind.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>During this phase we have gathered more feedback and refined the physical design of the music player. Next steps are to improve the UX/UI of the companion application and web platform- so that we can get it all back in the hands of our users for further testing.</p>","4","Recognition by sounds seems like something that will last. So the concept itself will stay viable. The form with the app might change over time.","In your research you found it the music association worked, so that is covered.  There are still some questions though. Are there different sounds per person the user interacts with? How does the user interact with the product? Will the user be able to remind themself to use the product? How are the sounds decided?","Depends a lot on the form of the product. Connection with app can be tricky but doable.","4","4","4"

Many caregivers can handle caring for their loved one aside from the obstacles that interfere.

Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging. Seniors: helps battle social isolation and creates a setting for purposeful aging via the mentor-mentee rapport that develops between seniors and caregivers.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are already currently running a similar- but grant-funded program- TimeOut@UCLA.In 2 years- TimeOut@UCLA has paired over 100 students and seniors- offering 3000+ hours of care. The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>YouthCare is the least expensive respite care that creates in an intergenerational bridge to create three very important outcomes. First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors). Our quantity and scale will be measured by the number of low-cost respite care hours we are able to provide.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Get our program off the ground at USC!</p>","3","It depends on how much the student is allowed to do. For some actions they need certificates. Ethically it is a bit questionable as the only reason students are being chosen is because they are cheap.","Students are already being used for these things.

EmPowerYu reassures caregivers when home patterns are normal- alerts them to problems- and measures the effect of treatments better than surveys- phone calls- or occasional visits. Knowing what is happening in the home- and having a system that will call out for help- reduces the stress and worry of a working or long-distance caregiver.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have systems in homes already.One test home is a full time caregiver of his aunt with advanced dementia.He likes to see what is happening at night when he is asleep- so that he can interpret his aunt’s daytime activities with the information about whether she slept well the night before.He also wants to use EmPowerYu’s front door sensor as an alarm so that if she leaves the house at night we can call his cell phone and wake him up to go get her.

App [Updated 12.20]</h2><p>A compass that always points home. Enabling people with dementia to go outdoors on their own and offer space for their caregivers.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me! Appthereby provides the opportunity for the caregiver to have more quality time with their loved one or for themselves.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We would like to constantly reflect with the community on the steps taken in our iterative design process. Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas. Later- we can find other test locations in the community.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>The PIT team consists of several professionals: - Maaike Thissen - professional caregiver at Pleyade - Rens Brankaert - professor at TU Eindhoven - Serge Offermans - technical & interaction designer - Hugo Nagtzaam - designer - Jaap van den Elzen - designer - Tijmen Stroeken - creative mind</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Watch me! Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me! App worldwide in Google playstore (Android) & App store (iOS) as soon as possible.</p>","4","Dependence on internet/app services/connection may affect the product , as they can change over time.","It will greatly increase the freedom and independence of a person with dementia. The product can be discreet, increasing the confidence of someone with dementia. It reduces the need for caregivers to guide them or search for them as well. One downside is that compass shows the exact direction, it does not incorporate different routes. Also there should be looked into how charging the product will be implemented.","The product is feasible with the current technology. The biggest challenge will lie into a stable outside internet/gps connection.","5","5","4"

Their loved ones often feel interrogated and tend to lash out. This puts stress on their familial bond. With the help of Hazel- caregivers can check in on their loved ones anytime- anywhere- via a mobile app- granting them more personal time. It also softens the tension between both parties by allowing for better conversation during visits; something beyond menial questions like “did you take your pills”.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have tested our sensors in a laboratory setting- but we need to retrofit our sensors in a few care-recipients’ homes and monitor them for a period of time to fully validate our methods. During these trials- we’d like to conduct periodic interviews to understand where we can improve our product design to better suit our users needs and preferences. We’d also like to conduct more discovery interviews with caregivers and care-recipients to better understand their daily struggles.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We would really benefit from hearing from the family caregivers and their care-recipients- and in general anyone with experience in this industry. The more we know about your daily struggles and pain-points- the better we can tailor Hazel’s experience to helping you solve your problems. We’d welcome any feedback- suggestions- and most importantly- if you’re willing to be interviewed by us- or participate in our field trials.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>We are a team consisting of: a biomedical engineering researcher who studies tech to objectively characterize Alzheimer’s disease; an electrical engineering researcher who studies IC design and power management; and a product designer who specializes in the IoT field.</p>","3","Depends how the product will end up like.","Unclear what sensors are being used and in what way.
