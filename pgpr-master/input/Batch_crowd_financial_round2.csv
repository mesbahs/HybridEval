The investment arm of a community endowment creates wealth through investment and support for local businesses. Profit from the investment activity is distributed as a dividend to shareholders who then spend this money in the local economy. Lastly- the other portion of profit is granted to non-profits which through their work raise community aura- thus circling back to benefit businesses and individuals.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>The community endowment concept draws on existing institutions; however- the novelty is in pairing an investment group- a co-operative mutual fund- and a community foundation under a single partnership. Instead of wealth concentrating in the hands of a few- it's distributed to residents interested in becoming a shareholder. This creates not only supplementary income but also a sense of ownership and pride in community.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Create a small experimental group of ten to twenty friends willing to invest $50 into a co-operative mutual fund or credit union like structure. Then- invest the sum amount in a local business through a low interest bearing micro-loan. Take the profits and distribute a portion to the shareholders and then the remainder to a non-profit that supports community and economic development. See how the non-profit's actions might have benefited either the business- shareholders- or both!</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>There is potential for this idea but many obstacles as well. The early obstacles are establishing a legal structure and ensuring the protection and stewardship of the shareholders' investment. Secondly- how can consistent profitability be generated so that shareholders receive a dividend? What can non-profits do to ensure their work is felt by businesses and citizens?</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An individual</p>","4","Depending on how markets due, this could or could not be viable in the long run.","I think it's an interesting idea that many people will at least want to try out, especially if they have extra money lying around.","If you find willing participants in this, it could be very feasible.","3","1","3"

In addition- the bank members will get a debit card for their social accounts to facilitate donating and create a simplified connection to those needing funds within the current system & community.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>Members of the community are often encouraged to do good by seeing others do so. The idea is to give social community hubs- such as cafes- libraries- stores etc. accounts in the community bank or connect them back to the network so as to use them as an outlet for people to use the social card. While buying a coffee- they can use their card to quickly donate to any of the projects registered at the bank. Meanwhile- allowing others to see a simplified way of contributing within their own community</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>A simple way is to create a sample of the social card and start using it within local community hubs and introduce it to the community. Thereby- you can test the communities reaction to the idea and their willingness to become part of the network whether as donor or receiver. It is also essential to test the banks willingness to set up such a network within their system- though it will not require their financial contribution- but merely their management.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The idea allows for a lot of creative development and assessment. This includes ideas such as cafes creating their own account for people to put in money for free coffee for homeless people etc. It will also require input and further development as to how to integrate it within the financial system and back to the community.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An individual</p>","2","It is for a good cause but it seems like it would be a hassle and the incentives just arent there.

For the physical Flea Market it is necessary to have a space in the community (either block a street in partnership with governmental authorities or partner with a local school) and promote the activity to bring as many people as possible with its different offers (goods or services).

I think real estate more than banking prefers it's customers with as little info as possible. Most real estate companies are more worried about their bottom line than building sustainable communities. They ignore the part of housing- residential rentals- where most low-middle incomers dwell. And where the most support is needed for property owners to reduce risk so capital flows.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I was able to discuss with a community bank- how they could get better and more info on renters from the property owners they finance. They only make multifamily loans and the gov't wants to make sure the funds are really improving communities. I did classes at the CHA on sustainable communities for a year and talked to countless owners renting to low income people on housing assistance vouchers.

Taman is farmer in Indonesia who does not have access to credit. But it will also create value for financial institutions (MFIs and Commercial Banks) and the Government. MSMEs will get loans and saving tools faster- easier and cheaper.

The idea will use informal networks of the community- informal data exchanged in the community and the existing trust between community member to develop and deliver the solution. Consider small holder farmers in Indonesia- they have community based solutions for agri-info and financial support. But there are ways to improve existing model to achieve scale and impact using data present in current model.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>An application prototype would be build to deliver on envisioned experience map for accessing financial services.

Providing The existing users of current model can be provided services to test the efficacy of the solution.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>I believe the solution to promote financial inclusion varies by community. There are a lot of informal models to doing daily activities that vary from community to community. Communities within a country are closely linked- but again vary by current work industry.
