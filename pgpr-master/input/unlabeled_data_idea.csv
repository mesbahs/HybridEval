Applying the same basic configuration of hardware (i.e. Bluetooth wrist band readers- wrist band tag up stations) as seen in a water park to track guests and pinpoint their locations- Vantage can achieve the same outcome in different locations that have a need- especially where occupants do not have cell phones—which is an already available technology. Vantage can be configured relatively quickly by the acquiring business for effective contact tracing.</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>Vantage will allow business to mitigate and control outbreaks- especially for vulnerable populations- aiding them to remain open and operational. Long-term care facilities- daycares- prisons—anywhere people interact for long periods of time in defined spaces can benefit from Vantage’s platform. In a best cast scenario- the number of people Vantage’s real-time contract tracing impacts is zero because no one a facility contracted COVID-19- on the other hand- should an outbreak occur- the number could be immeasurable.

In the short-term- the people who would benefit most from our platform are the people who are currently the most isolated. The need for Vantage arises when people are once again in closer proximity with each other throughout the day. In the long-term- privacy regulations and concerns may deter some business from tracking people with wrist bands or collecting their information in profiles.</p><h4>If you are currently working on a pivot- what have you learned so far?</h4><p>It has proven extremely difficult to connect with new markets and new verticals where we have no experience.</p><h4>Are you aware of any open source efforts- hackathons or other collaborative efforts related to your solution?

5,/challenge/covid-19-business-pivot-challenge-ideation/ideas/proximy, <h4>What is the need are you focusing on?</h4><p>Due to the current pandemic- people are experiencing social isolation in every aspect of their lives. Activities that were once enjoyed together in person have been halted due to the virus. Everything people have come to love about getting together can no longer be done in person. Proximy helps mitigate feelings of social isolation through participation in meaningful conversations and activities with people in their proximity. By doing so- overall improvement in physical and mental well-being increases resulting in a healthier outcome for those involved. As mentioned by Williams et al (2000)- social isolation endangers four principle components of human needs for life satisfaction: to belong- to have healthy self-esteem- to have agency over one’s life situation- and to have a meaningful life. Proximy provides a platform that strives to facilitate those four satisfactory principles and make a positive impact in each community.</p><h4>Which type of submission are you sharing?</h4><p>Identifying a gap that needs to be addressed Sharing a pivot idea your organization is considering or could consider Sharing an actual pivot your organization has already made</p><h4>Describe the business pivot or adaptation in 3-4 sentences.</h4><p>Proximy provides the user with power to bring people together online. People are matched and ranked based on their selected interests and relative proximity- with the goal to get people proactive and involved with one another in a meaningful way in their own communities. With COVID-19 in place- our business will pivot to provide a platform for people to bring new people together online through video-chats- group chats- and a live forum to keep connected in their own community.</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>Social isolation is a global problem that can have a serious impact on society. COVID-19 has amplified the feelings of social isolation as people now have to remain physically distanced from people they love. By providing a globally scalable platform for connecting with new people in close proximity- we are able to provide an actionable way to support one another through a problem that still plagues society and focus our efforts in staying physically and mentally healthy. Once society can return to normal- Proximy will continue to provide value and help people better connect with one another in proximity.</p><h4>What is the name of your business or organization?</h4><p>Proximy Technologies</p><h4>What is your profession?</h4><p>Engineers- Software Developers</p><h4>Where are you located (country)?</h4><p>Canada</p><h4>Where are you located (region)?</h4><p>North America</p><h4>What industry is your business/company in?</h4><p>Activist/Community Leader/Organizer Athletics/Fitness/Wellness Customer Experience/Service Technology Mental and Emotional Well-being</p><h4>How many people does your business/company employ?</h4><p>0-10</p><h4>How old is your business/company?</h4><p>1-2 years old</p><h4>Which classification describes your organization/business?</h4><p>Social Enterprise</p><h4>What kind of stakeholders and partnerships are needed to pursue this solution?</h4><p>Funding- Grants Funding- Investment Stakeholders/Partnerships- NGOs Stakeholders/Partnerships- Private Sector Stakeholders/Partnerships- Civil Society Groups Stakeholders/Partnerships- Grassroots/Community Groups</p><h4>Do you need help building partnerships and finding partners?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>If Yes to the above- please share 1-2 sentences describing the specific help you desire.</h4><p>New partnerships and partners are not needed to complete these additional development features and their integration as we have a development team capable of running the project but need to outsource aspects of the code creation due to the depth and complexity of the project.

This convenience will help patients with more progressive or complex diagnoses such as Multiple Sclerosis as well as patients living in more rural areas receive therapy at home. Long term- Therapy4all helps create a more just and resilient future by ensuring that the complex and intricate relationship between provider and patient is maintained regardless of any changes in the physical location of either party. As therapy services shift and evolve to a more periodic check-up paradigm (like dental model-of-care) Therapy4all will facilitate a preventative rather than curative health care model enabling people to schedule check-ups more efficiently. Moreover- Therapy4all ensures that therapy providers are more readily accessible to people and patients at all times- including after the therapy session.</p><h4>Which type of submission are you sharing?</h4><p>Identifying a gap that needs to be addressed</p><h4>Describe the business pivot or adaptation in 3-4 sentences.</h4><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic- the (healthcare) therapy industry is rapidly questioning its accessibility as to how many people and patients can readily be treated but more pressingly- how they can be treated more effectively and conveniently. One study found that physical therapy as a first treatment strategy resulted in 72% fewer costs for the patient within the first year. Therapy4All is created to help the therapy industry adapt appropriately. But on a national scale- it will facilitate a changing perspective on how the paradigm of therapy could be more resilient and better suited for the future.</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Maybe-with additional support</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>Therapy4All will help reinforce the therapy aspect of the healthcare industry and the accessibility of therapy for patients and people.

Another main barrier will be to integrate the platform's information with the clinics existing scheduling software. Last but not least- partnerships with legal entities to ensure the company is in adherence to the laws.</p><h4>Are you aware of any open source efforts- hackathons or other collaborative efforts related to your solution?

There- a plumber can give his service in exchange for rice and eggs. A fitness instructor can buy an online derma consultation by coaching the doctor virtually. A baby sitter can get eggs and chicken .</p><h4>Which type of submission are you sharing?</h4><p>Sharing a pivot idea your organization is considering or could consider</p><h4>Describe the business pivot or adaptation in 3-4 sentences.</h4><p>Because of Covid-19- people around the world are having economic difficulties.As a community the residents can survive together through barter trading just like the old times when there was no hard currency. It is inspiring because of the sense of community it brings. This will produce service and resource links. This will create new cooperatives for production. People can work together and later share the produce. People will all of a sudden realize that they need real skills that can be traded and used. In a world of browsing and learning too much without really doing- there is a laughable reality. People think that they know so much without actualizing anything. Young people has an overload of skills and DIY projects tutorials butthey hardly use what was learned. In this new reality- people will work harder. Instead of going to the gym- people can find work to dig ditches or do gardening- Get fit and get paid with food for the calories burned.</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Maybe-with additional support</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>Freedom from hunger. People will be more creative in selling their skills and inin using other people's skills. All communities that that has suffered much with the lock down provided they have strong WIFI signals. First- a survey in every village- in the Philippines we call it a Barangay. count the number of people who lost their jobs.People will do an inventory of their skill set (cooking - plumbing- baking- welding etc) They will post their skill sets.TheZoomba(rter) Organizer will then find the most reasonable standard price per hour or per day of service.Rates will be posted on a platform. People with goods to trade will then post the goods- they have. Let us say someone has 10 sacks of rice- but he needs his roof repaired or his garden tended. The prices for their goods will be posted as well. An actual zoom meeting will be held- they can then agree to exchange their goods and skills within the meeting and set a date or exchange numbers for future reference.</p><h4>What is the name of your business or organization?</h4><p>OLM Business Solutions and MarLiCa Art Gym</p><h4>What does your business/company do?

Since one always wants to have his hard-earned money at the end of the day- one might feel strange being paid in goods.

We made an app for Covid-19. The Bee Buzz App that we we made for the government. We worked on it day and night. Only to find out that we need to get a partner institution if it has something to do with COVID-19. We submitted it last April 11.

To publish the path we need consent of two sides: infected patients and authorities. People who are tested with covid-19 in most cases should be eager to publish the data in order to reduce the effects of the pandemy. We also need consent of the authorized person so that no fake paths are published.</p><h4>If you are currently working on a pivot- what have you learned so far?</h4><p>One of the major problems that we faced when trying to come up with some solution to coronavirus pandemic was the lack of reliable data regarding the movement of people.</p><h4>Are you aware of any open source efforts- hackathons or other collaborative efforts related to your solution?

EternityGardens.com has the industry contacts to reach end-of-life service providers while Care.com has the existing technology platform to offer lead generation and bill/payment processing functionality. Either organization can pivot to serve the new and emerging segment of ELPs; the ideal solution would be a collaboration between EternityGardens.com and Care.com</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Maybe-with additional support</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>The development of an ELP platform will make it easier for families to locate trained professionals and hire them. Because all ELPs will be certified doulas and celebrants and licensed grief counselors (by the appropriate organizations)- families can hire professionals with confidence. The ease of locating ELPs will also aid in the development and growth of this new and emerging market- thus increasing the ranks of doulas- celebrants- and grief counselors at a time when the expected number of deaths in the US is expected to rise with the aging of the baby boomers. With the number of deaths in the US expected to reach 3.0 million annually- and assuming at least 50% of families utilize at least one of the ELP services- the proposed idea has the potential to impact 1.5 million families and more annually.The ELP platform could be developed- build- and launched within 3-5 months.</p><h4>What is the name of your business or organization?</h4><p>EternityGardens.com</p><h4>What does your business/company do? Whose needs does your business/company address? Who do you serve?</h4><p>EternityGardens.com connects families in possession of cremated remains with scattering services and cemeteries where those remains may be laid to rest.Our business meets the needs of cemetery owners who are losing client-families due to the rising cremation rate and the increased tendency of families to take cremated remains home.Our business also meets the needs of families that are increasingly likely to choose cremation as an end-of-life option and who need a comprehensive - online resource to search for and connect with options to lay cremated remains to rest.</p><h4>What is your profession?</h4><p>I am an entrepreneur active in the end-of-life profession and an advocate for environmentally-sustainable (green) burial practices.</p><h4>Where are you located (country)?</h4><p>United States of America</p><h4>Where are you located (region)?</h4><p>North America</p><h4>What industry is your business/company in?</h4><p>Technology</p><h4>How many people does your business/company employ?</h4><p>0-10</p><h4>How old is your business/company?</h4><p>2-5 years old</p><h4>Which classification describes your organization/business?</h4><p>Business</p><h4>What kind of stakeholders and partnerships are needed to pursue this solution?</h4><p>Stakeholders/Partnerships- Private Sector</p><h4>Do you need help building partnerships and finding partners?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>If Yes to the above- please share 1-2 sentences describing the specific help you desire.</h4><p>The ideal partnership would be with a technology partner/investor similar to Care.com; a tech partner with experience building/integrating a billing/payment platform into an existing lead generation/business development technology tool.</p><h4>What do you think are the main barriers to implementing this solution?</h4><p>The main barrier is capital to build out the ELP platform.Beyond capital- another barrier is identifying the right technology partner to expand the current EternityGardens.com platform.</p><h4>If you are currently working on a pivot- what have you learned so far?</h4><p>More than anything- we have learned that technology platforms are incredibly pliable and may be adopted to meet the needs of many new stakeholders in many new markets.As we have discussed/shared the idea of the ELP platform- we have seen interest from estate planning attorneys as well as financial advisors to be included on the platform.</p><h4>Are you aware of any open source efforts- hackathons or other collaborative efforts related to your solution? Are you participating in these efforts?</h4><p>Yes- the Polsky Center at the University of Chicago hosts periodic hackathons.Once the stay-at-home order has been lifted in Illinois- we will participate in those events as they resume scheduling.</p><h4>Website URL</h4><p>www.EternityGardens.com</p>,5,1
10,/challenge/covid-19-business-pivot-challenge-ideation/ideas/vrgather-conferencing-re-imagined-virtual-offices-workshops-job-shows-and-exhibitions-through-a-virtual-reality-vr-platform, <h4>What is the need are you focusing on?</h4><p>With the world in lockdown and businesses unable to physically gather their employees- people’s jobs and livelihoods are threatened. Existing video technology is not sufficient to replace workshops of geographically-dispersed teams or internal and external summits some businesses rely on to operate. At the same time- students are unable to participate in classroom learning and traditional e-learning platforms are not sufficient tools for sufficient knowledge retention.</p><h4>Which type of submission are you sharing?</h4><p>Sharing an actual pivot your organization has already made</p><h4>Describe the business pivot or adaptation in 3-4 sentences.</h4><p>VRGather- the virtual meet-up platform can be used through web browser or mobile phone with headsets and a combination of the two. Safe- virtual- with all the bells and whistles of an in-person meet-up from panel discussions- keynote addresses- breakout sessions- one-on-one networking and even designable stands for innovation marketplace or job show exhibitions.</p><h4>Do you plan to implement this solution?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>Describe the impact that this solution will create in the world.</h4><p>To measure the effectiveness of VR training- XRG did a baseline study with USAID funded Feed the Future in Rwanda. A control group of agrodealers were provided traditional instructor-led training- these agrodealers had a 5% increase in knowledge retention. The agrodealers trained in VR saw a 45% increase- a 9 fold difference. With Corona we realized the impact we could have in empowering both small training organizations and larger businesses looking for meet up solutions for their geographically dispersed teams'- to have a technology to keep business going. We saw how XRG could bridge the gap between the old business as usual model and the new version during and after this pandemic. We re-prioritized to enable businesses to continue their work and in some cases increase the effectiveness of their work on the training side- so the people working for them could retain their jobs and livelihoods. VRGather will be launched next month and there is currently a waitlist for demos.</p><h4>What is the name of your business or organization?</h4><p>XRGlobal is our company that is transforming training and education across Africa through VR- Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) solutions . VRGather is an XRGlobal product which is our virtual conferencing and workshop platform- developed since Covid as a requested pivot by partner businesses.</p><h4>What does your business/company do? Whose needs does your business/company address? Who do you serve?</h4><p>XRGlobal's (https://xrglobalconsulting.com/) mission is to transform how training and education are provided to students- by upending traditional tactics and immersing trainees in the environment in which they are learning- through VR- AR and MR solutions. Our team of developers- subject matter experts- and instructional systems designers create immersive experiences with multi-sensory methods to remember- enjoy- and replicate learnings. This interactive methodology has a proven track record for significantly increased knowledge retention and through continued testing and a smart data-driven approach- XRG improves with each module. Beneficiaries are individuals needing skills development training- customers are training organizations.</p><h4>What is your profession?</h4><p>Social entrepreneur with nearly 2 decades of experience in sustainable development in Africa mainly in healthcare- agriculture and financial inclusion</p><h4>Where are you located (country)?</h4><p>South Africa</p><h4>Where are you located (region)?</h4><p>Southern Africa</p><h4>What industry is your business/company in?</h4><p>Academia/Research Agriculture/Farming Business/Consulting Customer Experience/Service Education Entrepreneur/Investor Technology</p><h4>How many people does your business/company employ?</h4><p>0-10</p><h4>How old is your business/company?</h4><p>Less than 1 year old</p><h4>Which classification describes your organization/business?</h4><p>Social Enterprise</p><h4>What kind of stakeholders and partnerships are needed to pursue this solution?</h4><p>Funding- Grants Funding- Investment Stakeholders/Partnerships- NGOs Stakeholders/Partnerships- Private Sector</p><h4>Do you need help building partnerships and finding partners?</h4><p>Yes</p><h4>If Yes to the above- please share 1-2 sentences describing the specific help you desire.</h4><p>Yes. We would love to have support and access to IDEO's large network as we believe the use case for creating a new business as usual is global not just in Southern Africa. We also are hoping to access funding partners such as Vodafone or other interested parties.</p><h4>What do you think are the main barriers to implementing this solution?</h4><p>Time and capacity! We are self funding VRGather and have limited access to our developers until we can bringthem on full time. We have some small barriers technology-wise that we are working through such as full use of bi-directional audio- but that is close to being sorted. We also have a challenge in terms of the lockdown and ability to deliver our cheap headsets. We have built VRGather to also enable use through the web browser but ideally want to enable the VR capabilities. We have small manufacturers of our branded headsets that construct and ship across South Africa for less than 10 USD. We have identified other companies who make cheap headsets across multiple other countries which should be able to deliver to those requiring them.</p><h4>If you are currently working on a pivot- what have you learned so far?</h4><p>We have been working for two months on VRGather and we have learned that the desire and need for VR conferencing- workshops and teaching is significant! We have everyone from lecturers from Oxford- SBS- University of Stellenbosch contacting us to event companies to small training businesses and large global FinTechs all waiting for demos and access to the platform. We have learned it's all about our capacity to deliver and as we are self-funding all of this- it's challenging to ramp up the development speed. We do have a pilot workshop scheduled for mid May!</p><h4>Are you aware of any open source efforts- hackathons or other collaborative efforts related to your solution? Are you participating in these efforts?</h4><p>We are checking out support initiatives but have not yet participated.</p><h4>Website URL</h4><p>https://www.vrgather.com/homehttps://xrglobalconsulting.com/</p>,5,1
