Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our idea is designed to help family caregivers understand how Alzheimer's affects the brain- and how that translates into progressive loss of many different functions -- not just memory- but also emotions- attention- communication- facial recognition- auditory processing- and spatial awareness. The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm A student collaboration An Individual</p>","4","Depending on the long term effects on dementia patients, this could be a good option for care.","This is an excellent option for people with family members who have dementia.  I could see lots of families willing to test it out.","It is certainly interesting territory and I think it's a great way for dementia patients to still experience things they love to do.","4","4","4"

First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Get our program off the ground at USC!</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors). Our quantity and scale will be measured by the number of low-cost respite care hours we are able to provide.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are already currently running a similar- but grant-funded program- TimeOut@UCLA.In 2 years- TimeOut@UCLA has paired over 100 students and seniors- offering 3000+ hours of care. The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>YouthCare is designed as a win-win-win situation for caregivers- students- and seniors with Alzheimer’s. Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging. Seniors: helps battle social isolation and creates a setting for purposeful aging via the mentor-mentee rapport that develops between seniors and caregivers.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p>","5","Since it is so wide-reaching, I think that is a good sign about how viable it is.","This is definitely something that a lot of people would benefit from.","It seems like you already have this off the ground and running, which is great.","5","5","5"

Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me!

Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas. Later- we can find other test locations in the community.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me!
