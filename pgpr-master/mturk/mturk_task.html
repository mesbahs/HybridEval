        <h3>The grading scale is from 1 to 5, where each grade correponds to the following description:</h3>
        <p><strong>5: The review is fair, constructive and detailed.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>4: The review is constructive but some points are unclear</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3: The review is somehow clear.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2: The review is fair but does not provide enough details. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>1: The review is unfair with very little details.</strong></p>
    </short-summary>

    <detailed-instructions>
      <h3>For each grade, we provide more details on when each grade should be attributed: </h3>
        <p><strong>5:</strong> Each point in the review is well explained, justified and the score is consistent with the textual review. For example, if the review criticizes the related work and the experiments, the review contains references to other related work that should have been included. If the review criticizes the methods, the review contains references to the paper itself explaining the flaws of the method. If the review criticizes the clarity, the review contains references to the unclear parts of the paper. </p>
        <p><strong>4:</strong> The review attributes a score consistent with the textual review. The textual review justifies some scores but leave some scores unjustified. Note that a low score (a decision to reject a paper) require justification. The high score does not require a justification</p>
        <p><strong>3:</strong> The review is consistent (scores matches the textual review). Some points are described in a high level way with no justification.</p>
        <p><strong>2:</strong> The review seems to be fair to the paper but not enough details justify the decision. Note that the decision to accept a paper does not require as much justification as a reject decision. </p>
        <p><strong>1:</strong> The review is described in a high level way and the score does not seem to be fair to the paper.</p>

      <p>This is considered a good quality review for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The structure of the review is clear (concise summary, mentions the strong points of the paper and provide details on the weak points)</li>
        <li>The review points to some related work missing in the paper and explains why it should be included.</li>
        <li>The review explains in detail why the contribution is limited in the paper (starting from "My rating is due" until the end of the review)</li>
      </ul>
    </positive-example>

    <negative-example>
      <p>The following review deserve a grade 1:</p>
      <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_WPEQ5e0KHQ63mmAj9pmceCP78_DyeY/preview" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" type="application/pdf"></iframe>
      <p>This is considered a bad quality review for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The summary of the paper takes the majority of the review (7/11 lines dedicated to summarize the paper )</li>
        <li>The critics are not justified for example saying "the novelty seems a bit limited and the experimental section seems a bit disappointing" is not accompanied with any clarification or justification why is it the case. </li>
        <li>The review is described in a high level way for example: "it is very likely that tuning the architecture for each size would have led to better results."</li>
      </ul>
