3TCFMTM8HE0K3R278UKHAQHF3HZ210,3TCFMTM8HE0K3R278UKHAQHF3HZ210,<h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>BrightGuide helps persons living with early-stage dementias relearn their daily routine through videos of themselves. This gives autonomy and peace of mind to their family caregivers. Caregivers use the BrightGuide app on a tablet to film and schedule instructions for vital daily activities. This provides contextually-rich and culturally-appropriate cues for assisting the person- with dignity.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our immediate next steps are:- gathering user testimonies and evidence through existing partners like Trinity Village (January 2018) - developing a refined native version of the app (March 2018) - deploying in the app stores with a payment option (April 2018) - nurturing partnerships through IDEO to understand local challenges worldwide (early 2018) - developing a go-to-market strategy that addresses national and global challenges (late 2018)</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>I have experience caregiving for my grandfather currently living with Alzheimer's. I have a BSc in Chemistry and a Masters in Business Entrepreneurship & Technology from the University of Waterloo. I have 3+ years experience health informatics innovation with Medella Health and Health Canada.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We know that bring a digital health solution to market requires the collaboration of many groups: we need help with telecommunications partnerships (providing stable- affordable internet access)- device hardware partnerships (ensuring families have accessible tablets)- creating efficient marketing and distribution channels and providing advocacy and caregiver education for behavioural health. Please see our How You Can Help image to answer our questions to the community.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We are seeking partners like AARP- AT&T- Google- Amazon- etc. to integrate BrightGuide into private homes. We can distributeour React Native app globally through popular app stores after usability tests in March 2018. To support global users- our legal council at Gowling WLG have developed Terms of Service suited for users' local laws. We will work with local chapters of Alzheimer's associations to support and train caregivers on best practices for using BrightGuide.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Cognitive: Brain imaging studies show visual cues can be understood until the late stages of dementia. Our own voice/face is more trustworthy to show us “how-to” succeed in daily activities Mobile: Our tablet case & UI design make it easy for elderly users to operate BrightGuide on the device they already own Economic: 80 families said they can pay $100 CAD per month- saving them thousands of dollars in homecare costs Global: Technique works in every culture & language- only needs WiFi</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We plan to measure the impact of our idea inside the app through weekly self-reported “check-ins” and metrics related to videos watched and skipped (didn't need the video/didn't do the activity). Weekly surveys: Caregivers are asked about their stress- sense of control and frequency of repetition to measure their emotional stress- role empowerment- time saved. Their loved ones are asked about their confidence in performing daily activities and self-esteem to measure their autonomy and dignity.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have partnered with a local care facility Trinity Village (www.trinityvillage.com) to pilot our idea with members of their Adult Day Program and Assisted Living facility. This experiment will allow us to give 6 participants tablets for 3 months while we observe their performance with and without BrightGuide. This is a great way to find how much stress the BrightGuide tool relieves from their care partners and how much time or effort is saved- enhancing quality of life for family care partners</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our idea is designed for caregivers with a loved one in the early/mid-stages of dementia- whose focus is independence. Adult child caregivers face career and parental responsibilities at the same time- and need tools for vital daily activities. We support family caregivers by teaching families new ways to interact with loved ones/increase quality of life at home. By creating wellness within families- persons with dementia achieve self-determination and families thrive when they are resilient.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,4,4,5,4,5

This has been the inspiration of asking chefs in restaurants to contribute both locally and world wide.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>People who have dementia and those who care for them and who are afraid that they will someday be the patient need Feed Your Head…food is family- food is fun- food is community- culture and is our sustenance- it is our medicine. When the neurologist’s first prescription for Kris'sAlzheimer’s was to eat very dark chocolate every day. Instantly- our vision of the food pyramid fell to pieces and was replaced by an understanding of diet for good brain health.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,1,1,3,4,3
