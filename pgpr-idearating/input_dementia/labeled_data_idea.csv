A very early service prototype could be posting an ad for live-in caregivers to the targeted millennial demographic and an ad for families who have loved one(s) with dementia. This can be done in the form of a Craigslist ad or job boards (for the live-in caregiver) and in the form of posts or conversations on communities (for the families of those with dementia). This idea provides live-in support for those with dementia- giving loved ones an affordable way to get assistance in caring for their loved ones- while providing millennials with a way to save on rent and give back. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter,0,3,4,5,3,0

Helping us test our idea- by using your experience of games and play for human centered-design -- suggesting how to best engage families with dementia patients.Strengthening the storytelling approach to the kit in order to keep it relevant and feasible for the caregiver to execute it. We can build games and activities with existing toys (that we already own) and print out a small toolkit which we can test with friends and/or family that care for both dementia patients and their kids. Through this process we can receive their feedback and ask if they would benefit from more material and new activities that could be offered through an app. The toys will be designed for both dementia patients and children and benefit caregivers by engaging and entertaining players in activities and games.The toolkit will give caregivers important information for them to facilitate the activities- but also train themselves in supporting patients with dementia. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,3,3,4,3,0

Collectively- we experience in design- user experience- healthcare- fundraising- and caregiving. 1) What privacy concerns should we address? 2) What would make this most appealing/attractive for all key constituents to use? 3) What is most appealing about this idea? 4) What barriers (besides the fact that not everyone is online) could get in the way?5) Would a journal/book version be helpful for caregivers who do not have online access? 6) Where can we find people (at all levels of the caregiving spectrum) to show our prototype? 7) Should this be a subscription-based service? We would like to prototype elements of the online platform as a physical binder- then conduct open-ended- in-person interviews with users to gauge their response. GERI is for family caregivers of all ages. GERI is an in-home voice-activated virtual assistant and app that helps delegate tasks to others- coordinates care- & reminds caregivers to take care of themselves through creative activities.Through the use of GERI Caregivers will be able to make time to take care of themselves and connect with others knowing that their loved one is also being taken care of. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter An Individual,0,2,3,4,3,0

Assess their appropriateness for use with family caregivers. - Provide guidance for developing empathy assessment tools. - Provide guidance for testing assessment tools with family members. - Identify effective ways to identify differences in the cultural expression of empathy by major ethnic groups. - Provide guidance on setting up Empathy Training Bootcamps. - Brainstorm on deployment techniques. Find several family caregivers for an informal discussion about empathy and current ways they used. Obtain family caregivers' perceptions about empathy as a caregiving tool. For example- Sibley Senior Association has memory care groups in lower income DC neighborhoods and could recruit family members for this experiment. This program is designed for family caregivers for persons with Vascular Dementia- Alzheimer'sand Lewy Body. This idea supports appropriate expressions of empathy by rates of dementia in major ethnic groups and healthcare providers. Culturally appropriate expressions of empathy prevent disruptive behaviors and reduce isolation in care recipients. Use of empathy as a caregiving tool provides caregivers with a greater sense of control and reduces burnout in them. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An Individual,0,1,3,4,2,0

Matthew Boreen- 15 years experience as a senior technology leader- entrepreneur- app design and development- AI- and machine learning. We know we need to prove this works with other families. The question is- what are the key metrics to look for? We are currently exploring go-to-market strategies and gaining attention through related topics on social media. We see the OpenIDEO community helping us by identifying strategic partners- identifying future growth techniques- and validating the UX/UI of our mobile app design. Adoption is critical and we know our users need to have an incredible user experience for this to happen. We are starting with a 1-month alpha that includes Leslie and her sister tracking and monitoring their mother's health routines. We will then begin a closed beta with 5 families who provide care for a senior with Alzheimer's and Diabetes. The beta will last 3-months as we track metrics and milestones that validate our mission of increased patient medical compliance and collaboration. Lastly- we will monitor the health changes to further prove our methodology works with other families. VitalAlly enables patient- families- and caregivers to collaborate to help seniors remain medically compliant and manage chronic diseases so they don’t become life-threatening. The system consists of 1.) a twice-a-day medical routine with reminders and care team alerts- 2.) tracking and reporting health indicators such as sleep and mood and 3.) unique user experiences. These three items combine to benefit families through lowered medical costs and reduced guilt through collaboration. 4 months - 1 year An Individual,0,2,3,3,3,0
33N1S8XHHMXA925JX1TVX1RMOQY1Z7,33N1S8XHHMXA925JX1TVX1RMOQY1Z7, We are 3 students at the MFA Transdisciplinary Design program at Parsons that has a service/system design approach emphasizing on collaborative design-led research within social innovation. We are in a ‘Designing for End of Life’ class addressing tensions on difficult conversations about dying. We envision that having a collaboration with the OpenIDEO community and co-designing together through creative sessions- would be a great learning experience to combine methods- spaces and perspectives. Including these insights of collaboration will definitely helps us reshape our project- fostering a safe non judgemental space for patients and caregivers and start to breakdown the stigma around the illness. A few weeks ago- our team attended a conference called ‘Opening Up About Alzheimer’s: a conversation with Geri and James Taylor’- who are nationally noted Alzheimer’s activists. Since then we have meet with them privately and invited them to collaborate with us once we had a more formulated project idea. On the other hand- we would like to reconnect with The New School’s Institute for Retired Professionals (IRP)- since we know some of participants are alzheimer non-clinical caregivers who ha Dementia changes significantly how a person experiences the world. Our first instinct in reaction to this might be to try to hold on to how things were before. However- trying to limit or adding constraints to these changes can create more difficulties for all the people affected by the disease. Our design intervention is an invitation to explore how a person with dementia and their family members can connect on different levels- that would allow the emergence of moments of better understanding. 0-3 months A student collaboration,0,3,3,4,4,0

The concept that we are using is based on having high impact- low technology- high level of interaction and low complexity. We have been talking with different caregivers about what they missed and what they would want to do during their work because sometimes they have really weak and hard moments to confront with the person in charge. Our idea desing is based on the opportunity to help the caregivers reducing their weak moments with the execution of different activities each day. Each 15 days this activities would be update for them(per month 2 boxes). 0-3 months A student collaboration,0,2,3,4,3,0

Access to web resources encourages lifelong learning- entertainment and people-to-people contact. I believe that technological resources can help caregivers in their daily routines. In order to implement this proposal- it will be necessary to contact experts dealing with dementia (physicians- physiotherapists- psychologists and nutritionists). In addition- it will be necessary professionals who have knowledge of digital accessibility to elaborate the portal and implementation resources. I will need the help of OpenIDEO to develop this project. The goal is to integrate information- community of caregivers (through the forum) and specialists. Once health professionals guide caregivers to access the portal- and caregivers realize the importance of this communication environment- access will increase Elaboration of a portal with several resources (videos- interviews- forum- research) and gamification so that the caregiver besides having information about the disease can participate in a support group and have quality of life 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,2,2,2,0

I think it would be good that the openIDEO community would provide some guidance in terms of design thinking process and technology vision. And also- it would be good if relevant parties which can deliver more inside and professional suggestions to the specific topic can give some real time feedback for design ideas if someone consults (like realtime idea exchange). This is a conceptual Idea which haven’t been tested in the community nearby yet. But the Core idea is to share human Resources by location proximity and to help out others who are in need as much as we can since we share the similar empathy. The idea is designed for someone whose loved ones got dementia (at the early stage) and they are usually too busy with lives to deliver full time care giving to their loved ones. This app would help them to monitor their loved ones’ health state in real time and when there would be any emergency happening- they can easily check and reach out someone in the community nearby their loved ones to do a favor for them. 0-3 months A student collaboration,0,3,3,2,3,0
3421H3BM9AT2YS3AJS52ODLF3499J3,3421H3BM9AT2YS3AJS52ODLF3499J3, Caregiving can be very stressful. Dance4Healing is an AI-powered tele-exercise platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected- increase accessibility to group exercise- and build healthy habits in a fun way. Our mission is to reduce caregivers’ stress- combat isolation- and improve both emotional and physical health by bringing dance- community- and cross-generational support to home care. Our next steps are working with partners and potential funders. 1. OnLok- launch an anxiety and depression reduction program for dementia patients/caregivers. 2. Avenidas- start test the program at their centers. 3. RWJF: advised by program officer Michael Painter to apply for pioneer grant. 4. Moore Foundation: encouraged by President Harvey Fineberg to apply for community health grant. 5. Chan Zuckerberg Fund- launch an intergenerational program pending the result of our grant application. I have an extensive background in human-centered design for brands like Yahoo- AT&T- VW- and Sony. Stage IV cancer pushed me to dedicate my life to innovate and improve both patient and caregiver experience. I was also trained in social entrepreneurship at Stanford and Singularity University. We were amazed by the data in the design brief- especially the personas provided by IDEO.org- and the journey map provided by AgingWellHub. We are excited to see countless great ideas submitted to the site and already see opportunities for potential collaboration. We are grateful that our favorite company- IDEO- has a similar focus that is so close to our heart. We look forward to benefitting from OpenIDEO’s incredible resources and using them to build out and refine our idea. We are working with OnLok to launch a program designed to reduce anxiety and depression for dementia patients and caregivers. We plan to scale to 233 PACE centers nationwide- serving over 40-000 participants. OnLok founded PACE for the government and is internationally recognized as an eldercare leader. PACE also relieves the burden of caregivers by offering breaks that enable them to better focus on their mental and physical health- and allowing them to spend more time with their families. Dance4Healing is designed for accessibility with a tiered model. Our target customers are Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly- Medicare Advantage Plans- and Elder Centers. The basic platform with 40 pre-recorded dance videos is $250/month/location. Caregivers can access the platform at elder centers or from home with no charge. Customized content can be created based on their preference to increase engagement. All the programs only need a computer- wifi- and willing participants! Over 1 year Impact will be measured by tracking how many classes caregivers attend- how long they dance- which videos they use- and how they feel before and afterwards. Sensor tracking will be implemented via partnership. Clinical measurements like Zarit Burden Scale Short and CESD-10 has been recommended by our clinical partner- Stanford professor Dolores Thompson- expert on reduce stress- anxiety and depression for dementia family caregivers- a 25 year Geropsychologist and NIH funded researcher. We conducted >100 interviews and tested our product in elder centers across SF. Our research revealed two most popular activities in elder centers. 1. music and dance- and 2. cross-generation activities. We are applying for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community fund with two local non-profits to set up a cross-generation program. University AME Zion Church is the oldest African American church in Palo Alto- already offer tech education program. InATalent brings teenagers to dance with seniors. Our idea is designed for caregivers taking care of a loved one with early and mid-stage dementia. My mother- at age 72- became my caregiver while I was fighting stage IV cancer. During this difficult time- I felt guilty that I made her age a lot- and today I worry more about her as she turns 77- especially recently when I had to take her to the ER and she became hospitalized. This dynamic role shift has enabled me to see how scary and stressful caregiving can be. A student collaboration,0,3,3,3,3,1

Input and guidance on establishing the algorithm for this information will be helpful- as well as any feedback from community members with first-hand experience as dementia caregiving. This idea requires a degree of community-driven knowledge that will not be possible without active participation. Build a small network of family caregivers to seed information about themselves and the unique solutions they hacked during their caregiving experience. Using this information- we will connect caregivers and iterate on what factors play an important role in helping them connect to what they need to meet their family members where they are. This idea is designed for family caregivers at various points in their caregiving journey. By providing them with an outlet to connect with dementia experts- community-driven answers- and human connections- this concept harvests the successful techniques of caregivers in the myriad situations that arise with dementia to create a body of knowledge that is as human and personal as the caregiver's experience. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter,0,2,1,4,3,0

My mother was diagnosed in 2008 with Corticobasal Ganglionic Degeneration. I & dad were the alternating primary & secondary caregivers- without burnout- until her sad demise in 02/07/17My vow to quell dementia- roots here.. 1) A platform to work on this idea- & deliver global ascendance in living qualia of degenerative individual.2) Guidance to help bring the best out of this idea. 3) A center for degenerative diseases- where lots of ongoing work on dementia is taking place- so that patients come repeatedly for assessing their state of neural degeneration. 4) Influence of like minded researchers in the field of dementia 5) An opportunity for educating myself further. 6) A loving & progressive society The results of my pilot study- with 100 geriatric test subjects- is what propels me to surge forward with this idea. The observation of a simple thread of logic is helping me unravel neural mysteries of dementia. The abstract of my study has been attached herewith this idea. If we can join hands to pursue this idea- into a clinical regimen- we'll be able to save- exponentially more geriatric patients than one ever clinically can- to negate the slippery slope of degenerative darkness!!! Clinicians- Caregivers & the individual itself. Its range of benefit decreases as we travel from clinicians to care givers to the individual itself. Clinicians have the greatest advantage as it gives them a graded scoring system for correlation between a measurable physical attribute (Baseline mV strengths) Vs subsets in geriatric population- with respect to Mental exertion / Physical exertion / Nil / chronic illness / degenerative diseases. as they incorporate it into their day to day lives.

We can hypothesize many possible advantages to specific data collection- as given above. However- collaboration with the OpenIDEO community to brainstorm ideas for what data could help caregivers- refine the ideas- then prioritize the ideas with real caregivers- would be terrific.We want to work with caregivers to validate the usefulness of these ideas- and connect an alert with next steps like a televideo conference with a behavioral expert- music therapy- or talk with an avatar. We have systems in homes already.One test home is a full time caregiver of his aunt with advanced dementia.He likes to see what is happening at night when he is asleep- so that he can interpret his aunt’s daytime activities with the information about whether she slept well the night before.He also wants to use EmPowerYu’s front door sensor as an alarm so that if she leaves the house at night we can call his cell phone and wake him up to go get her. We will experiment with this soon. EmPowerYu is a Care Management tool ideal for optimizing care delivery to persons who cannot accurately report what is happening at home from day to day. EmPowerYu reassures caregivers when home patterns are normal- alerts them to problems- and measures the effect of treatments better than surveys- phone calls- or occasional visits. Knowing what is happening in the home- and having a system that will call out for help- reduces the stress and worry of a working or long-distance caregiver. Over 1 year An Individual,0,4,4,3,4,0
356TQKY9XF990SJYDRARLRLVS3R785,356TQKY9XF990SJYDRARLRLVS3R785, MindBytes is developing an evidence-based educational tool that consists of a scenario-based serious game and an e-learning to reduce burden of informal caregivers. All content has been derived from scientific literature and validated with experts. The serious game has been tested in four focus groups of informal caregivers. Dementia stakeholders in Belgium have confirmed the need of such a tool. Our immediate next steps are to finalize the e-learning and integrate the package into an online environment. This will be carried out in close collaboration with Flemish dementia experts. We have submitted a grant application in Belgium and expect to receive an update in Q1 2018. The intention is to launch the finalized version in September 2018 in collaboration with the dementia stakeholders who are already onboard (clinicians- academics- government- advocacy- healthcare funds- etc.). My background is healthcare - I spent 3 years working in clinical trial management of large-scale clincial trials before shifting gears to my current position. In my current role of Scientific Integration Expert I ensure that scientific evidence is translated into our educational tools. The most interesting input from the OpenIDEO community would be related to how can we bring this evidence-based educational tool from demo stage to the market. Due to the complexity in healthcare and the robust number of stakeholders involved it's not clear as to the best route that we can take to get this tool into the hands of end users. That being said- we have finalized a plan for the European market in collaboration with dementia stakeholders in Flanders- Belgium. We have a clear plan for scalability in Flanders- which will serve as proof-of-concept for other regions. As dementia advocacy and support groups operate at regional levels- we will focus on marketing MIB Coping Dementia to regional groups such as Alzheimer's Society- Alzheimer's Association- etc. We have well-established connections with such groups outside of Belgium and plan to move into new European countries each year starting in 2019. We will initiate a simultaneous plan for North America. We expect that MIB Coping Dementia will be provided to end users at no- or minimal- cost. Our intention is to license the tool to regional dementia patient and caregiver networks focusing on established family groups. Two elements that will facilitate this is the low barrier for moderators and the forthcoming online accessibility. This will ensure that MIB Coping Dementia is accessible to all those that wish to attend an in-person session or use it independently at home. Over 1 year The impact of our idea can be measured at a personal level by integrating questionnaires into the tool and analyzing outcomes over time. Alternatively it could be measured at the regional level by evaluating pooled user data such as: number of users- times accessed- outcomes- etc. This idea has already been evaluated through several focus groups of caregivers of individuals with dementia in Flanders- Belgium and was also evaluated by several clinicians as part of a masters thesis at the University of Leuven in Belgium. These initial focus groups provided excellent input from the target audience into the needs and expectations for such a tool. Additional focus groups could also be carried out in other jurisdictions where the company operates- such as North America. The idea is designed for caregivers of loved ones with dementia and it provides support to these individuals by both educating and empowering them. Education is provided through an e-learning component and cognitive feedback offered during the scenario-based serious game. Additionally- the scenario-based tool offers a safe- virtual environment where caregivers can test coping strategies and experience the implications of their actions in realistic and recognizable scenarios.

I would host focus groups with caregivers caring for a loved one with dementia to get input on whether they would like to use such a device and rate on a scale basis how they feel about having such a device. The Help U Care Assistant would educate the caregiver about how to deal with behaviors that accompany Alzheimer's disease- such as- resistance- agitation- wandering- resulting in a great reduction of caregiver stress and allowing the care recipient to remain at home- thereby- cutting long-term care costs. The Assistant would be built on top of a device such as the Google Home or Amazon Alexa already existing in millions of homes- making it accessible to many. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,2,3,3,3,0

We plan to conduct more research: - Interview experienced/former caregivers on communication preferences - Ask for feedback & interest levels - See if & what social/cultural variables affect caregivers to develop flexibility - Uncover the motivations why people share or are looking for info- and also how they want to do it AND why they won’t. - Run a pilot program with Monica's group and participants - Identify orgs to help scale into & address underserved communities Monica and Kevin work closely with caregivers and their families. Dianne and Sarah are UX Strategists. Hever has experience in marketing research and caregiving. Kim is CEO of a digital healthcare product.Our combined industry experiences cover healthcare- consumer products- and nonprofits. We welcome feedback from new caregivers- former caregivers- and other nonprofits in this space. We are planning to first nail down the framework & run a pilot program. Through a co-development process- we will incorporate findings from different cultural groups to evolve Hivemind to be flexible & culturally relevant to diverse- underserved communities. From there- we will roll out the mentorship program with established partners before releasing it as open-source to all.The outreach/recruitment for the “mentor pool” can be scaled via assisted living facilities and memory centers. Hivemind seeks to augment the efforts of nonprofits and facilitate more access to mentorship and support. Nonprofit operators will scale from Hivemind framework of templates- processes- and platforms. - Nonprofit personnel costs are only 1-2 hours per week or month. - Responsive website (accessible for all devices) will be paid for by donations. - Mentor are unpaid volunteers. We can consider aggregating discounts and benefits. - Mentee access is free- with a pay-it-forward pledge. 0-3 months Impact measurements could be: - Overall satisfaction of mentees (new caregivers). This could include pre and post-use measures by mentors and mentees. - Positive feedback from mentors and mentees - Positive effects on nonprofit resources - Growth rate of the program and mentor participation turnover and future use consideration Two of our members work with Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research at UCLA and Cedar Sinai's neurological department. We can test- prototype- and refine with them and their organizations. In fact- the day after our design thinking workshop- one of those teammates said how an immediate a difference our idea might make for one of her support groups. New family caregivers are overwhelmed and lost with how to navigate their new realities. Former caregivers are still passionate about giving back and can participate actively in this communitybased on their schedule and knowledge base. Also- nonprofits can connect those caregivers with their resources and networks. A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter,0,4,4,3,4,1
36FFXPMST909E9CQXHLZ9Q0PLBRHOK,36FFXPMST909E9CQXHLZ9Q0PLBRHOK, I am college student with a major in biology however one of my favorite hobbies is regularly attending and often winning Hackathons(programming events designed around creating a new idea using a specific theme or product)and Developer Conferences-both big and small- such as the 2017 one by Box I would like the OpenIDEO community to input their opinions on how they think the app should look like as well as information on how they would feel using this all as either a patient or caregiver.As well- what do you think about combining with use of a worn device like Concept N. Finally what social information do they think would be most important for the app to display and should it be only inputted by the specific family members themselves or could it be info gained by other members as well. To test how FamilyTies could help patients- my grandfather will be the first patient. Recently he received the diagnoses of dementia and though most often stable sometimes reacts like he has confused me with my father wondering what I am doing at their house despite me being a common visitor. After a small bit of explaining I will see how both my grandmother and grandfather react when using it and test for the next week or so how it has affected their relationship and his recognition of me. Caregivers- patients and their family members are both important parts of this idea. FamilyTies will support caregivers by making it easier for them to help a patient understand the importance of the family member in front of them and keeping connected with the family members they love. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,2,2,2,0

Working with local artists- we can create first boxes with caregivers and their loved one then solicit feedback from the family caregiver- care recipient and visitors. The Memory Box is designed to be co-created and used by caregivers and loved ones at any time during early to mid-stages (1-5) of disease and kept by the caregiver as a beautiful celebration of the individual NOT the patient. As social interactions and activity require more of our loved ones they retreat. Isolation- boredom and loneliness quickly settle in. But it can still be a magical time- where even complex things loved long ago are possible. The trick: putting these activities at hand. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,2,3,5,2,0

We also want to hold joint meetings- where both patients with dementia and their relatives will participate -thereby we will try to improve the quality of care and relationship to each other.In the future- we plan to involve the social services of the city in these events. With the current rhythm of life- stressful situations- housing and financial problems- the presence of a person with dementia in the family becomes a real catastrophe for many people. Our idea is based on striving for situation in which the prevention of dementia is provided- and people with dementia and their caregivers live a full life- and receive help and support they need to fully realize their potential and live decently and independently within the conditions of equality and respect.

I am passionate about public health causes and was thus drawn to ideating for this challenge. I have learnt a lot through my research and was excited to develop my idea! Since my idea is to build a network of dementia nonprofits globally it would help if the community worked together to find nonprofits that work in the field of dementia globally. I would talk to my local dementia nonprofit about the idea of a dementia friendly neighborhood and if they have looked into it. Find out any issues they have with implementing or fundraising for this idea and gauge their general opinion of this research concept. This idea is catered towards caregivers feeling isolated. According to a study (Farrell M.T 2014) people with dementia were excluded from neighborhoods due to their reduced ability to follow social engagement rules. This increased caregiver burden as their loved ones with dementia experienced social withdrawal symptoms. According to a study (Duffin C 2014)- the Neighborhood Friendly Movement has helped relieve the stress of caregivers by helping local neighborhoods redesign their open spaces. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,3,5,3,0

After working in children's book design for 5 years- I attended the SVA MFA Design program- where GreyMatters began as my Master's Thesis project. Since graduating- I have moved into entrepreneurship as Founder & CEO of GreyMatters- launching the app in 2015. I would love to gather feedback from the OpenIDEO community regarding possible strategic and/or research partnerships- ways to reach a larger community of caregivers and care communities- as well as feedback on the product from a community of caregivers for future development. I have already been pilot testing the app at various nursing homes and care communities- where I have received positive feedback from staff members as well as family members of residents. I have also been testing the app with individual family caregivers who are caring for a loved one with dementia. I hope to continue pilot testing the app and gathering research data that demonstrates GreyMatters' positive effects on quality of life for both patients and caregivers. GreyMatters was designed to improve daily life for both family caregivers and their loved ones with dementia. GreyMatters helps to relieve caregiver stress by keeping loved ones with dementia engaged in a meaningful way- which in turn reduces negative behaviors and improves mood. The app's reminiscence activities also give family members of all ages the tools to connect & communicate with a loved one more easily- when it might otherwise feel too difficult to try.

Publishing- editing and writing of some additional stories that add to the sequence and design language would best add to idea. We can print a few test copies and distribute them to some primary caregivers to gauge their responses. This is designed for family caregivers- who participate in the experience learn about their loved ones emotional state and level of receptiveness. Then- this helps them understand their current emotional state and- therefore- give better emotional care.

They worked together at The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research- Epion Health- and on 2 award-winning Hackathon teams from NY Presbyterian Hospital and ghg Healthcare Group. We'd definitely love to hear from caregivers about how they could see this app seamlessly fitting into their current solutions to weekly caregiver planning and coordinating with other family members. We already have a wireframe prototype- built in just a few days- that is ready to be user tested on caregivers of people living with Dementia. From there we can develop a lightweight working prototype to collect real data from actual users. Learn and iterate from there! Orbit Care is designed for caregiver teams. When a parent has Dementia- their multiple children & their partners may team up. Coordinating care can be overwhelming and can change over time with the disease. This planner- specifically designed for folks coordinating around Dementia- guides them through potential to-do's and allows the delegation of tasks to anyone involved in the care.

We are a collection of clinicians- researchers- engineers- policymakers and designers. Connecting us with organizations advocating for individuals with dementia and their caregivers would be very helpful as we could receive feedback about the VR experiences we create and discuss potential barriers to implementation from unique stakeholder perspectives. Of course- bringing widespread awareness of our initiative using OpenIDEO’s various powerful social media platforms will be very helpful in extending the project scope and seeking industry partnerships that could ensure its success. We completed an initial feasibility study (n=56- three sites) validating the use of VR among people with dementia when administered by researchers in a controlled environment. Given the positive findings- we improved the VR-therapy and are ready to evaluate it with larger target patient population- engaging caregivers through joint participation in the study. We intend to evaluate the process of administering the VR therapy by formal/ informal caregivers- and people with dementia themselves. Our goal is to reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia that contribute to caregiver burnout and often result in the institutionalization of a loved one. We have created a library of VR “experiences” (e.g. calm lake- tranquil garden) that aim to stimulate psychological/cognitive health by decreasing depression- anxiety- and aggression and reducing wandering. This approach is less costly and more dignified than many current practices (e.g. neuroleptic drugs/restraints). Over 1 year A group brainstorm,0,4,4,4,5,0

Our work is designed to offer support to support today's caregivers who struggle in isolation. Cognizant of the stigma and physical accessibility issues that keep these individuals from reaching out- our app allows tailored small group support from anywhere- and anytime via text and voice.However- with access- comes the potential for abuse- so our AI tools run on messages to detect the underlying emotions - flagging inappropriate msgs- and detecting when a caregiver may need additional help Over 1 year A group brainstorm A student collaboration,0,2,3,3,3,0

Top floor please! The next step is getting our wireframe coded in swift. After that- we will build awareness by partnering with local dementia/alzheimer's foundations along with the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab research hospital. We found that many primary caregivers are highly involved with walks- fundraisers and political lobbying events- which are ideal opportunities to present our product directly to our users- we will be focusing on marketing at these events. Our team has a diverse background with members that have been healthcare consultants- software designers and healthcare researchers. A majority of our team is now enrolled full-time in the design masters/MBA program at Northwestern-Kellogg University. Volunteers are motivated by the rewards system. We can assemble OpenIDEO community business leaders to submit rewards on behalf of their companies and organizations- which will not only incentivize volunteer caregivers- but also provide a prime marketing opportunity for them. Recommendations from geriatric experts and small launches partnered with professional societies would be the initial spark to kickstart this platform. Moving forward- word of mouth via local support groups and aid circles among alzheimer’s patients’ families will help keep the customer base growing. Our research demonstrated that this app is about as easy to use as Uber- which is a service that has scaled to millions of users around the world. The application is entirely free for family caregivers and family members willing to help; those two demographics should enable the platform to get scale. We plan to incentivize volunteer caregivers in the final version of this app to ensure that anyone can find care on their schedule- regardless of their financial condition. Only if a caregiver opts for a professional help will they be charged. A portion of this will be used to continue updating and extending the app. 0-3 months The key objective is to protect free-time for the family caregivers inproblematic moments- regardless of their pocket size. To discover the impact of our services- we will ask family caregivers to answer questions (tension index) in the beginning to monitor tension and stress levels. We can periodically monitor and track responses to these surveys and compare it to the initial benchmark to measure effectiveness of the platform as a means to improve their experience. We can launch an alpha version of this app with a small group of volunteers and primary caregivers that we know to better understand how we can tweak the model and add additional functionality. The idea is designed for the primary family caregiver. Taking care of a loved one with dementia can be very time consuming and emotionally taxing. ShareCare gives primary family caregivers the ability to step away for a few hours either to manage other tasks in their lives- or simply to take a break from the strain that care-taking may be causing.

We would really benefit from hearing from the family caregivers and their care-recipients- and in general anyone with experience in this industry. The more we know about your daily struggles and pain-points- the better we can tailor Hazel’s experience to helping you solve your problems. We’d welcome any feedback- suggestions- and most importantly- if you’re willing to be interviewed by us- or participate in our field trials. We have tested our sensors in a laboratory setting- but we need to retrofit our sensors in a few care-recipients’ homes and monitor them for a period of time to fully validate our methods. During these trials- we’d like to conduct periodic interviews to understand where we can improve our product design to better suit our users needs and preferences. We’d also like to conduct more discovery interviews with caregivers and care-recipients to better understand their daily struggles. Caregivers constantly visit their loved ones to make sure that they are safe and healthy. Their loved ones often feel interrogated and tend to lash out. This puts stress on their familial bond. With the help of Hazel- caregivers can check in on their loved ones anytime- anywhere- via a mobile app- granting them more personal time. It also softens the tension between both parties by allowing for better conversation during visits; something beyond menial questions like “did you take your pills”.

Initial idea was a collaboration with Hans van Wetten and Eriano Troenokarso. The interaction part is pretty straightforward- however the backend is still open. How are people going to put music on the pillow? Is there an online platform where family members can easily upload their songs? How can family members record their own stories or music? How does it work with music rights in this situation? We have put the pillow in context- as you can see in the video.. and it shows great potential! Next step would be to make a small series of pillows and let them be tested over a longer period in time at home of a person with dementia or in a nursing home context. The idea is designed for people living with dementia in the mid to late stage of the disease. People with dementia tend to turn to their own reality- and this might come across as being lost. Often conversation is no longer sufficient to connect with someone with dementia.

I involved in some student projects in healthcare and marketing areas using design thinking mindset. I belive that the best solution is the one that can solve the problem within constraints. It will be very helpful if OpenIDEO can give suggestions on the UX/UI experience of the website. Perhaps also can give some ideas on the improvement of the business model especially on the coin/reward trading system. I have co-create with some other group users to see the usefulness of the website and the concept. I also have test-run the website with a few care-giver. Feedback --1) the safety issue. Some commented that they worry about the motive / the identity of the requester. 2) The token awards can be transactional better -with rewards that has moremeanings or useful to the requester. It can exchange stuff for the needy group. My idea designed for caregiver. Someone like me who needs to work and taking care my mother. I am a caregiver too.My idea is to give the caregiver a platform of mental and comfort support and advise- so that we can have enough knowledge or tips from others to handle some unforeseenincidents.

I advise and present across Canada and internationally on topics such as caregiving- Ageing in Place- and designing assistive technology in the dementia community. We are open to any clear examples from situations where this Care Cart could have been useful.Our team is looking to prioritize the challenges that this solution will improve. With prototypes in development- we plan to test out a few variations of a Care Cart with actual caregivers and individuals living with dementia.We have already interviewed numerous family caregivers and those with dementia to provide feedback and wants from this cart.This low tech solution will not be difficult to learn from the caregiver or person with dementia.It is their feedback that will be of great value. The cart is primarily used for the family caregiver to assist in daily caring activities by keeping everything organized in one place.It also offers a secondary role to support the loved one with dementia to utilize the cart if they are still able to benefit from its accessibility nearby.Lastly- it also allows the family caregiver to prepare the cart ahead of time to be used by any other person supporting in caring responsibilities such as a personal support worker or other family members. 4 months - 1 year A group brainstorm An Individual,0,5,5,4,5,0

The programming- development and testing of virtual reality applications is going to be invaluable of course- but also of great value will be the organizational skills and the leadership of online communities. The establishment of a small virtual group of caregivers and some of their distant family members- friends and volunteers dedicated to their emotional support- equipped with virtual reality headsets and cameras- that are going to participate invirtual group therapy sessions. The idea is designed for caregivers- who have access to the internet- and it helps them using a virtual reality gear to immerse in a virtual community of other caregivers- distant family members as well as volunteers who wish to provide emotional support to them but are unable to be physical near them. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,1,3,3,0
3G5RUKN2ECFYHIUVYQXUHK2WCOE9N7,3G5RUKN2ECFYHIUVYQXUHK2WCOE9N7, I serve as the VP for Innovation and Planning at ASAE: The American Society of Association Executives. This is a spinoff of an idea generated at an OpenIdeo Workshop -- posted here as GERI: Virtual Assistant for Caregivers. What organizations are already encouraging artwork by caregivers? How is that going? The National Center for Creative Aging has a Creative Caregiving initiative. Caregiver.com hosts an annual Caregiving Art Show. Who else is doing something similar or complementary? How would we find artists and writers to give mini-lessons? Would the site need to be private- for registered users only- to encourage amateur submissions?Should we allow people to connect with others by commenting on their work? Perhaps we would start with writing classes and art classes for adults. These classes attract older people- many of whom would likely have caregiving experience.If we could find a way to give these people an assignment -- e.g.- express your caregiving experience via the artistic medium you're already exploring -- we could begin to assess proof of concept. Asking a random busy caregiver to express herself artistically might be tougher- but photography could be an easy entry point. We think of caregivers as stressed and depressed. This project flips that script- elevating caregiving to an experience that naturally generates and benefits from creative expression.This online portal provides a peaceful- inspiring- validating place caregivers can go to any time of day or night to see their experience reflected in others' artwork -- and upload their own creations- however amateur. The message: Caregivers are artists- each with their own stories to tell. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter An Individual,0,4,4,4,4,0
3G9UA71JVV6YK9FH4V7IAHU98EL7JP,3G9UA71JVV6YK9FH4V7IAHU98EL7JP, My work as a designer is mostly furniture based. In my masters degree- I worked directly with elders and people with dementia. Apart from that- I've also worked as a waiter. Experience with elders and people with dementia will always be a great input for the project. Since every case is different- sharing experiences people have had can potentially bring both new problems and solutions to the table- that might help the product improve. Also- different backgrounds and cultures may provide new ideas for similar approaches using different products or activities. Although the idea has been tried and tested- each person has a unique story and experience- and very particular level of ability. More so for people with dementia- where every case is a unique case.In this sense- improvements and adaptations can allways be made. At this stage- a really interesting next step for the project would be to explore more ways to stimulate creativity through the loom- as well as ways to involve more people around it. Tear (portuguese for loom)- is designed to help elders and people with dementia stay active- stimulated- motivated- included and creative. Weaving is something most elders know and like- so taking advantage of that- a loom was created that compensates for many impairments associated with old age and dementia- both physically and mentally. It allows elders to prove to others- but most important- to themselves- that they are still able. Over 1 year A student collaboration,0,2,2,4,2,0

The last two years developing chatbots both voice and keyboard input. Finding more ways to alleviate caregiver duties- including implementing sensors- which the DotBox is ready- adding more community events- and can be done more effectively if we knew what sensors seniors at the present moment would be able to use and would even use if they were available.Also- working with physicians who may notice someone experiencing the beginning stages of Alzheimer's and prescribes the DotBox to reinforce normal everyday practices of activities of daily living. The units are programmed to each individual zipcode and lists community events that serve the aging-population- Meals on Wheels menu and location specific information.Home health organizations are most likely to benefit first due to the translation and push-notification ability to each unit.Family members also can contribute to the personalized conversation offering insights for better communication which is used to fight against isolation. 10-000 units in houses is the target model. The DotBox E-Caregiver is designed for aging-seniors- their children and admininistrators and works 24/7 to answers important questions a senior may have at any time in regards to their activities of daily living- their residence or the community they live in or have been a part of for many decades.The service also allows seniors to receive messages from the children/administrators in a professional- respectful and understandable manner- over and over again.

Formerly on Basecamp's team and currently contributing to curriculum strategy- UX design- and content for Designlab. Feedback about these major goals would be super helpful: 1) ways to improve Herd's ability to give caregivers an easy way to ask specific questions and receive fast- reliable responses. 2) ways to streamline how caregivers can share their personal expertise and first-hand knowledge to less experienced caregivers- while receiving gratitude and recognition within their peer community. Initial surveys were distributed to participants to gain a deeper understanding of perspectives- behaviors- and experiences with regard to dementia-related caregiving- as well as visits to local support groups and interviewing participants from the targeted user group about their caregiving experiences and challenges. Since then- high-fidelity prototypes have been designed and we'd like to continue more rounds of user testing with caregivers in the community to enhance the user experience. Herd is a tool specifically designed for family caregivers. While caregiving resources are plentiful- it was discovered that online support resources for caregivers were- at times- difficult to find or navigate. Response times to questions ranged and questions sometimes received only a few responses- which varied in terms of relevancy or helpfulness. The goal is to alleviate caregiver stress by reducing wait times while increasing relevancy & helpfulness of responses to caregiver questions. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,2,2,3,0

Also- the possibility of making this idea known worldwide will be helpful. The booklet and the toy will be tested in numerous exams in different institutions- that would give us the necessary information to improve the project and receive appropriate feedback from the caregivers and the patients. We created this idea with a main purpose- to generate strong bonds and relieve between caregivers and people with dementia in situations that involve stress and pain- like the ones produced in psychotic attacks.The booklet and the toy will be a tool to reduce the stress and overcome the attacks- serving as an instruction book for the caregiver and a relieve to the person suffering the attack. 0-3 months A group brainstorm A student collaboration,0,2,2,3,2,0

It simplifies the process- and gives them the ability to program events (like re-occurring TV shows) so that they can have a break in the day and know that their loved one is comfortable and entertained.

This idea is completely untried. I think it needs to be piloted in a medium-sized city where respite services are lacking and caregivers are in distress. The primary obstacle will be developing a critical mass of potential volunteers. It will require input from local organizations within the test market. The volunteer service allows overburdened- overwhelmed informal caregivers in need of support to connect with other caregivers and/or former caregivers who are able to provide volunteer respite care so the active in-need caregivers can have a break. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,3,4,2,0
3KI0JD2ZU1UMWE0AKCDT1DP4M8176J,3KI0JD2ZU1UMWE0AKCDT1DP4M8176J, Embodied Labs creates immersive virtual reality experiences that allow family care partners to embody a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain. 1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile. Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship. Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia. The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones. Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public. Over 1 year We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver? In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents. Our idea is designed to help family caregivers understand how Alzheimer's affects the brain- and how that translates into progressive loss of many different functions -- not just memory- but also emotions- attention- communication- facial recognition- auditory processing- and spatial awareness. The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.

I have a background in project management and we are looking to start an OpenIDEO chapter in Guatemala! We think it would behelpful if we can have proven and easy to use tips- resources- strategies- or approaches to prepare for and manage the role of being a caregiver. Like we mentionedbefore- we want this to resemble the DesignKit or The Circular Design Guide by beingquick- to the point- practical- anduseful. On that note- if there is anyone in the OpenIDEO staff that had anything to do withdesigning andbuildingthose two toolkits- we would love if they could share their insights. Create a mock up website to design the structure of the toolkit along with preliminary information outlined in the structure of the site above. We would work with professional/experienced caregivers as well as doctors- centers- and communities to build out the content - making sure that everythingincluded is intuitive- practical- relevant- and understandable. We will then run a pilot to test our assumptions with current (to see if they would have found this valuable) and new caregivers.

After struggling to be a good caregiver for three of my loved ones- I founded CareXc to provide a virtual village for other caregivers who are facing similar situations. This solution is an application of CareXc. Communication is key in a team-based activity plan.For OpenIDEO community people the following can make this solution stronger as well as increasingly advanced and better going forward: - those who provide advanced communication mechanisms especially those that are instant or the mechanisms that are suitable for different age groups - those who provide content management that can help caregivers' self-care- or better organize CareXC's total care plan - those who provide analytic solutions. We are in the process of planning a trial of our solution with a local senior community residents and their children to understand the difficulties and benefits of using a team approach. Furthermore- we want to get some validation and feedback on the design of the team-work process. Designed for family or professional caregivers as well as the care recipients. When care-giving- people always forget about their own care. With a team- caregivers and loved one(s) share their time to stay connected - make it both social and as part of a treatment plan for everyone.

3L55D8AUFA9URF5CHCGW0Q1BMTLCYH,3L55D8AUFA9URF5CHCGW0Q1BMTLCYH, It is a digital music player and application designed for people with Alzheimer's.Along with the well-known benefits of music- their songs help them remember who they are- but there wasn't a music player on the market that has been designed for their specific needs. So we designed one- along with a platform for caregivers so that they can manage the music library and music therapy. During this phase we have gathered more feedback and refined the physical design of the music player. Next steps are to improve the UX/UI of the companion application and web platform- so that we can get it all back in the hands of our users for further testing. Two of us are Interaction Designers at different tech companies and two are Industrial Designers working at design consultancies. We all graduated together from Umeå Institute of Design a few years ago. We have diverse professional backgrounds between us- including work in healthcare and wellness. We'd appreciate any help that gets us closer to not only bringing this project to life- but improves the system and experience we are proposing. We'd also love to hear about the community's experience providing care with the help of music. Also we're eager to find technologies that can enable the seamless interaction between the people and the music at just the right moment. Remind is a system that includes both a device and software- but we plan to design a version of the ios and android app that can be used without our music player- but instead using existing personal devices- speakers- and headphones. The concept can not include some of the features but will be scalable as long as there is music. We will educate people on how to use it through the website. Throughout our design process we have prioritized solving usability issues that people face- such as loss of dexterity- poor vision- etc. Concerning accessibility in terms of cost- organizations such as Music and Memory are dedicated to the efforts of sourcing and distributing mp3 players- as well as recruiting volunteers. We aim to keep our price below the ones they currently use- to make our Remind system an opportunity for everyone. Over 1 year By observing people use it- as well as feedback- stories from caregivers and nursing home workers on their experiences using the music system with their care-recipient. Since this an emotional topic- we want to provide a space for users to share the success and challenges they have in an open forum- to help them help each other strengthen their relationships while spreading awareness of Remind. We have evidence that proves the concept could work for some and we want to dedicate more time to using music to try to awaken memories with individuals across various stages of Alzheimer's- and together with caregivers and at nursing homes. We also feel the design of both the app and tangible music player needs to be refined for both the caregiver and person living with Alzheimer's respectively- therefore we would continue crafting and testing mockups and prototypes until it's good enough. Remind is designed for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers. Patients are connected with their families through a personalized music device and mobile application. The device is used by the patient and managed by their family members or caregivers through the app. When the patient does not remember a face- a sound is used in place to “remind” the user and trigger memories.

Our team is made up of students in Design- Engineering- and Marketing at the University of Illinois. We are always looking for unique input from present- past- and future caregivers. Whether you are a grandchild or a neighbor of someone with a memory disorder- you know how much the disorder can change the daily life of that individual. We aim to improve the physical and mental well being of everyone involved in the caregiving experience. If you identify as a caregiver and believe Therapalz can make your experience easier- reach out to us at Therapalz@gmail.com and on social media @Therapalz. Therapalz have been designed alongside users with memory disorders as well as their caregivers in both homes and nursing care facilities. To ensure that the Therapal adds value to caregiving experience- we interview caregivers when developing new features- and then cycle-through the user testing process with individuals memory disorders. We can watch the emotions of users- gauging how the Therapal makes them feel when it is introduced to them- and when it responds with a friendly purr. Therapalz makes smart therapeutic companion cats and dogs for individuals with memory disorders. The Therapal recreates the animal assisted therapy experience- providing the same experience as interacting with a real therapy cat or dog. To mimic the experience- the Therapal has a constant heartbeat- lifelike sounds- and responds to user interaction with a purr in both our cats and dogs.

Inspired by the research legacy of traditional Multisensory Environments (MSEs)- our app works together with Philips Hue smart lights- and is designed to extend the virtual experience into the physical space. - Finalize pilot study design- measurable outcomes and IRB application. - Incorporate Alpha prototype feedback to new iteration and content creation. - Refine and polish prototype for the pilot study- focusing on simplicity -core features and meaningful content. - Maintain weekly visits to the community- showing staff a new iteration of the prototype each week. I am an experience designer & visual artist- currently pursuing a MFA in Interactive Media & Game Design at the School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles- California. Experience with interaction design- visual design and film. More: www.aboutgabi.com As we prepare for our first pilot next semester to collect feasibility data and build an initial case study- our project could benefit from guidance in how we could start consolidating the idea for a larger scale deployment- moving from a MFA thesis to an actual product- or experience package- as we like to call it. If there are any writers- artists- sound designers- iOS developers and engineers in the community who are interested in the project- we would love to hear from you! In its post-thesis life- Healing Spaces would be available for download in the App Store- and would also have a robust online presence- a centralized place where caregivers can find extensive documentation- resources and updates- learn more about sensory-based activities and engage with the community. I would love this home page to encourage users to build upon our tools- and share their own experiences with our product- allowing us to keep creating content that is fresh and meaningful. We use commercially available off-the-shelf components and take into consideration the reusability of each component in other aspects of care. We chose to design this smart platform as an app for the iPad because it gives caregivers and our end users instant portable access to not only our experiences- but also to a whole ecosystem of applications and resources. We also adopted a modular design approach. Healing Spaces is made to work with both low-end and high-end setups (see Setup infographic) 4 months - 1 year We’ll be conducting a feasibility study in a memory care community in late February. Our goal is to examine if Healing Spaces helps reduce agitation in persons with dementia- if it is engaging for both users- and if it makes sensory-based activities easier & more enjoyable. We'll be using two assessment tools to measure agitation and engagement- as well as direct observation notes- surveys and interviews with caregivers. Results will be shared in the form of a case study. With a robust prototype in the works for Spring 2018- my goal is to maintain regular visits to one of the communities we're working with- sharing weekly prototypes and gathering feedback.We also plan to conduct playtest sessions and workshops with caregivers- in collaboration with the USC Family Caregiver Support Center- making sure we also have the perspective from those caring for loved ones at home. Healing Spaces is designed for both professional and family caregivers- and those with mid to advanced dementia. This project focuses on the design of playful sensory experiences that have the potential to address the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Our goal is a cyclic process of prototyping- testing- analyzing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this way of working. Each step of the design & development process should be made better by opening it up and talking to people from different areas of expertise. We have build a virtual window- radio and picture frames and are planning to place this in a living lab located at a Dutch care institute. This is done in collaboration with Eindhoven University off Technology. With the consent of the family we will wizard of oz the installation to test if the multimedia surroundings add value to the experience and has the desired effect. This is designed to open up late stage dementia patients- helping them to get the much needed contact between patient and caregiver. As dementia patients regress into final stages they often close up to the outside world. Caregivers find it harder and harder to reach and recognise their loved ones. They find it hard to talk to them and miss the emotional connection that once was there. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,3,3,2,4,0

I have a caregiving blog (http://unforgettable.live) and have been primary caregiver to my two parents (both with dementia/Alzheimer's) for three years now. I'm well connected- bilingual and a skilled social activist. I think this idea is self-explanatory; it would require an app developer working with someone like myself to ensure optimal user-friendly design- appropriate content- adaptability to each user- and the opportunity to grow and evolve with continuous use. It could even collect and share data with relevant associations and organizations- providing valuable feedback on the state of caregiving and dementia care globally. I'm currently managing a team of five caregivers- along with four siblings who pitch in to help as necessary. I would be happy to design the template for a comprehensive app that would impact all areas of caregiving and resources for people with dementia. Designed for family caregivers- offering valuable and accessible information and tools to help manage behaviour- coordinate family efforts (nothing yet on the market for this!)- keep all data in one central place- watch budgets- find emotional relief- connect with relevant health care professionals and offer an interactive experience for solutions and support. Caregivers are often exhausted from having to seek solutions; this will allow more QUALITY time with loved ones- essential to wellbeing. Over 1 year An Individual,0,3,4,2,4,0

I have led large and small teams- both domestically and internationally. I have worked for Apple where I initially balked when they called technology transformative but then saw it was first hand. I would like to hear from others about what has worked in their experience- what devices they have found most helpful- what teaching methods worked best- and what others have found to work for them in improving the quality of life for both caregivers and seniors. I would start with a small class at the local Senior Center- sponsored by a manufacturer to test not only the training but the devices as well. Based on that small test I would branch out within my local city to neighboring cities and other venues to determine the right size and space for optimum class responsiveness. Technology is frequently thought of as too complex for seniors. If taught in the right venue- this new technology can actually transform the lives of seniors and their caregivers. Tablets- smartphones- and voice-activated speakers can extend the time seniors can stay in their own homes- add safety- answer questions- replace safety monitors- provide entertainment (music- playlists- books on tape)- and even reach out to caregivers as needed. The key is in making the training accessible. 4 months - 1 year An Individual,0,3,2,4,4,0

For more than 7 years I have been the primary care partner for my husband who has Alzheimer's disease. As his disease has progressed- I have discovered the urgent need for what I call companion care- as differentiated from caregiving. Identify priority targets among educational programs where potential student internships can be created or expanded. Locate Bay Area organizations such as area agencies on aging and the Alzheimer's Association who will provide oversight and patient participants for a pilot group. Identify potential funding sources for the pilot project. Identify one or two institutions with studies in art therapy and gerontology to explore prototypes for companion care. For families of patients with Alzheimer's- finding and training companions with the requisite education and maturity is fraught with challenges. Working with educators in the SF Bay Area- I propose to explore opportunities to recruit students in art therapy- gerontology- teaching and spirituality as interns to help fill this void. By focusing on activities to engage the patient- the intern will gain real world professional experience- and simultaneously offer respite to the family caregiver. 4 months - 1 year An Individual,0,2,3,3,2,0

Throughout the design development- co-design sessions with people with dementia- carers and healthcare professionals are being consulted to provide input to ensure relevance and appropriateness of the design. The Good Life Kit offers post-diagnosis support for persons with early-mid stage dementia and their loved ones/carers to deal with feelings of uncertainty and insecurity after the diagnosis- and to prepare for and manage changes and challenges positively. Through a mindful and positive psychology approach- the kit will support and empower persons with dementia- and thus reduce strain on carers. It willincrease empathy and mutual understanding to strengthen the relationship between both. 4 months - 1 year A group brainstorm,0,3,4,4,4,0

Piloting the welcome kit concept with newly diagnosed members and their caregivers would be quick and easy.Operating a support group may be more complex- but could be organized around a community center or other care facility for people with dementia- where caregivers are already congregating to visit their loved ones. Caregivers of people recently diagnosed with dementia need tools to help them get started in their new role and as their experience evolves.By equipping them with language and communication tools- they will feel better equipped to care for their loved one and help them navigate social space that have newly become unfamiliar. 0-3 months An Individual,0,4,3,5,4,1
3NQUW096N6K8TIRAMDHF4SY77TE9L5,3NQUW096N6K8TIRAMDHF4SY77TE9L5, It’s a really simple card game for someone who is going to be the primary care giver for a loved one who has recently been diagnosed with dementia- to talk about what matters to each of them in order to start preparing for their journey ahead together. We are aiming to approach the services which we have identified are key to reaching the people who will benefit most from our game. We want to bring them on board whilst we develop the tool- so that we can ensure it is accessible and works with the systems in place. We are a team of three- passionate about driving change in healthcare. We work at Bupa-a global healthcare company which funds healthcare around the world and runs clinics- dental centres- hospitals- care homes and retirement villages in a number of countries. Once we have a prototype- we would like to test the cards with as many people as possible to ensure we have accounted for all the possible things which may be important to care-givers and care-recipients. Testing with the OpenIDEO community will also help us ensure the cards are as inclusive as possible of other cultures. Our idea is simple – two decks of cards with instructions which can be distributed from front line services- such as the NHS Memory Service and Admiral Nurses in the UK. To maximise our reach we will partner with charity organisations (e.g. Alzheimer Society UK) to spread awareness. As models of dementia care develop from residential to home care- we believe we have a role to play- eg. services which train informal care givers to care for their loved ones in their own home- would benefit from it The statements chosen for our cards are the result of our conversations with relatives and care givers and relevant to both the care-giver and care-recipient. A card game as it is an inexpensive way of promoting vital conversations- as well as being a familiar activity (playing cards) to most people. We are exploring the possibility of an online version as well as testing across different countries. Our early conversations give us confidence that the game can be translated and localised. 0-3 months We would aim to pilot the tool and hold focus groups with participants to receive feedback. We would like to measure “sense of confidence” about the future before and after using the cards. We would also like to know what actions have come from having the conversations promoted by the cards- as well as whether people would recommend the game to others. We will be testing our idea with the family caregivers and mental health nurses we interviewed during our research phase. We will also be testing the idea with a professor who has over 25 years experience in dementia care and is internationally recognised for his authority on dementia care practice and policy.Secondly- we would like to test the idea with care homes in Spain- New Zealand and Australia (to test the idea cross-culturally) and local community groups working with elderly people. The idea is designed for both- family caregivers and their loved ones at the early stages of being diagnosed withdementia- to support a meaningful conversation about what really matters - to them- as individuals and together.

The community could assist in ideas for marketing- SEO- and insight into future collections.As a veteran owned business- we would like help reaching out to veteran organizations.We are using US based companies for production and insight into production would be helpful.Our greatest need is to reach the seniors/caregivers and marketing directly to them. We need guidance with the viability and assistance with options for creating an affordable online/on-demand reminiscence solution. Favorite things reminiscence products were developed using feedback we received from professional caregivers working within facilities- and individual caregivers for their loved ones in their homes.We have made many changes and enhancements based on feedback- some of which were- adding music to our videos- size and durability of cards- and subject matter.We continue to work with caregivers- do onsite visits with caregivers and those they care for as their feedback is key. While our products are designed for both the professional and personal caregiver- and can be used in a facility or at home- with a group or an individual- we find the one on one experience to be the most person centered.By individualizing the experience to the cared person- participants can find joy and be comforted by connecting through conversation- happiness and a reprieve from isolation- sadness and depressive thoughts.

The OpenIDEO community offers a tremendous opportunity to learn from- not just feedback on the concepts- but your knowledge and experience that will help guide us on the best approaches in the implementation- deployment- scaling- and marketing.Our set of partners and collaborators have been extremely helpful in helping us get to a successful and sustainable business case - but we really love the opportunity to tap into your fresh ideas and connections to help bring about change in this space. We will run a Sprint- where we mock up the Forum- and the MAC user interface- and quickly code the connections.We will test this with 5 or 6 caregivers that we have never worked with- but are inthe greater Indianapolis- Indiana area to verify 1. the technical feasibility- but more importantly- 2. the utility.We will then ask the caregivers a set of questions to collect their feedback on how to best present information and interact with them before proceeding to the work plan. Care4Caregiver supports family members as they transition into the role of caregiver of a person with dementia by connecting to a nationwide support network to help them: plan for and recognize the disease progression signs- execute this plan.A tablet app simplifies all the typical complexities of web-based forums- and coaches them on how to take care of themselves physically and emotionally so the journey is sustainable so that the senior with dementia receives the best care possible. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,2,3,4,4,0

We are interested in expanding accessibility to our target audience by forming new connections with community groups or care facilities where a group of people could access the webinar together from a central location.Doing so would give access to those who may not have available the necessary equipment. This would also increase the potential for formation of community support networks.OpenIDEO's global connections- network- and know-how would be a wonderful resource and partnership in this. The Series was piloted in 2016- and five online groups have been conducted since.Moving forward- we plan to make the series available in a community setting with the intentions of reaching a greater number of people and increasing the potential for caregiver support.This strategy can be piloted with a community organization with whom PAC has already established a working relationship.We can refine the logistics in this setting prior to offering it in new communities. This series is designed for family and friends who are caring for a person living with dementia.The main focus of the series is education and information dissemination regarding dementia and dementia care.Additionally- an important component is the community of support that the series provides to the participant through meeting once a week over the course of a five-week period with a small- consistent group of people- all of whom are caring for a loved one living with dementia.

Whether I’m assisting a family in-home or leading a live training for a long-term care community- my work centers on one thing and one thing only—focusing on what individuals with dementia can do. I would be interested in having advice regarding potential obstacles to success of this project: Family members of people with dementia are stressed and over burdened.How can we convince them to invest time to try something they have never heard of before? Would family members be willing to spend time learning the Montessori techniques?What are the best methods of data collection in the home?Would family caregivers be a reliable source of data? I have successfully educated many professional long term care staff about Montessori for dementia- and recently began teaching home health care professional how to use the approach to help prevent responsive behaviors and engage individuals in meaningful activities.It has been very successful.I would love to work closely with a large number of families and help them to use the approach in the home and collect data about the success of the approach in relation to behavior reduction. Montessori for dementia helps care partners to be proactive- not reactive- when it comes to unexpected behaviors.The approach creates an environment where elders needs are met- enabling them to be more independent.There are things to do that match the person’s cognitive abilities and individuals with dementia are encouraged to develop daily routines and to do as much for themselves as possible.Their dignity is maintained and family and professional care partner stress is reduced.

Special interest for designing for and with senior citizens. It would be interesting to create an easy platform to be able to test this idea in multiple cultural contexts. In this way we can share experiences and make it adaptable to different needs and wishes. Next to quick & low-fi prototyping- we would love to improve the prototype into making it more reliable. For this we need a technical person who could program a stable programme. A prototype was created to test the concept in-context. With this we have seen with one couple- the person with dementia was happy receiving messages directly- rather than via his partner. Also- the messages were played multiple times and in addition both felt very thankful for receiving personal messages from loved ones especially for them. We would like to extend the time period of testing and also increase the number of participants- to get a better understanding of their opinion/experience. This design is both for the caregiver and for the loved one with dementia. Caregivers can send voice recordings via WhatsApp (common used messaging device in The Netherlands)- for example recording a message with the sounds of the sea on the background. A loved one with dementia can play these messages on the radio by switching the knob towards a picture of a family member- which illustrates there is a new message by a blinking light.

Isolation can be a major driver that increases the effects of dementia.We are working on a digital solution to keep them connected with their families and loved ones Conpago will continue to refine the Companion in order to give end users the best experience possible. We will look continue to look for funding so that we can push this product to the international market. Conpago aims to alleviate the burdens that caregivers have by implementing any new innovations that appear in the world of tech- whilst ensuring people with dementia maintain a good standard of living by allowing them to have as much independence for as long as possible. Our ever expanding team has an array of experience from health and fitness- software engineering- user experience- business and design. We all share a passion for innovation and problem solving. We work closely with professionals from the aged care sector find their sore points and create solutions. We see OpenIDEO as a great platform to bring to light many of the issues faced by this community- and in doing so- provide a network of like minded people to help create solutions- enable aging in place- and break down the stigma of aging.The greater community will see long term benefits as well- with a load taken off healthcare systems and aged care providers as the solutions created off the back of this program begin to alleviate people's dependence- and provides them with autonomy The Conpago Companion will have corresponding apps downloadable on any iOS or Android device- allowing any number of caregivers or family members to interact with the dementia patient. This device can be effective for caregivers with loved ones at an early stage of dementia- allowing for ageing in place through the device's passive monitoring ability. This same device has already caught the attention of nursing homes aiming to a reduce invasive checkups on their permanent residential patients. Conpago has redesigned the Companion in order to achieve greater accessibility for caregivers. The Conpago Companion now fits any existing tablet available on the market. This lowers the cost to caregiver and dementia sufferer. Through the new design- we have been able reduced the cost by 50%- allowing greater affordability to end users. Over 1 year Conpago is focusing heavily on the user feedback from end users- especially caregivers of individuals the early to mid stages of dementia. This is the primary way we plan to measure the impact of our idea- since our goals are aimed towards assisting caregivers. The secondary way of measuring the impact of our idea is the increase of independence given to caregivers by using the Conpago Companion- through the use of task distribution through the Conpago app. We have been working on ourfunctional prototype and have established connections with two large aged care providers to help test our prototypes and find out how effective they are.We are working closely with these two aged care providers in South East Queensland as well as a research team at the Queensland University of Technology to run user testing and feedback sessions with elderly users to sculpt the product into something that will be easily adopted. Our product is designed for an entire family network to use with the key beneficiaries being the primary caregivers and elderly user. It is a way to enable passive communication using existing daily routines- or habituated appliances such as a kettle. Because it uses existing routines it can also be a reliable way of passively monitoring if an elderly user has been active. A group brainstorm,0,1,1,3,1,1

It combines a visual diary with context about people and places in reminders with access to in the moment help and information- which are offered when the platform detects changes in patterns of user behaviour. The Prompt app is currently iOS (iPhone and iPad) only- we will be reworking the technology so it can be delivered to any platform- with Android and a web/browser based service for families as priorities. We will be upgrading the analytics to improve the way we can interpret a user's behaviour to see changes and also to predict what they will need. Community tools will also be developed to start the process of building a support service. I started Memrica when I couldn't find a solution for a family member. Previously I led strategy for games for health for a UK developer-partnering with the US Dept of Defense. I helped set up the UK's Serious Games Institute have worked in government policy and started my career as a BBC journalist The first version of Prompt by Memrica is on the app store- feedback and suggestions for next steps would be hugely appreciated. Input on the right level of support at the right time and building resources that are accurate- valid and digestable would be very valuable.Familieswho are currently on this journey and who would be interested in co-design- please get in touch! Long term- the service must be sustainable- so thinking on commercial models is welcome. The app stores are powerful distribution services; clever marketing is essential for discovery . Translation into multiple languages in the long term will support global reach. Sourcing and collating online information can be achieved through intelligent search. Connecting communities for meaningful- personal support is more challenging; initially we will tap into current support networks to link users to help- and long term will develop local groups of people willing to share their experiences. The current model is to offer the visual diary app for free for people living with early dementia- with an additional small subscription charge for premium services such as family access to analytics that show patterns of behaviour. To date- this has been modelled on £5/$6.69 per month. Feedback from user groups suggests this is affordable and families are willing to pay for peace of mind. An alternative approach is to attract sponsorship from companies who wish to support people with dementia. Over 1 year Our aim is to keep people with dementia socially active as long as possible- which will help them feel well and in control- which in turn will reduce stress for families. We can use analytics to track patterns of social interaction- baselining when users adopt the app and measuring change. We can compare aggregated results against current known patterns of social decline. We will also ask family users to track their feelings- using emoticons- to see how mood changes when they access support. Explore current local resources and determine if they need expanding or augmenting. Gain permission to share contacts Ensure people in my community have downloaded the app Add a notification service to the app suggesting local contacts based on current location Track responses to notofications Gather feedback Prompt is designed to adapt to users’ and families’ needs as a dementia journey continues. Initially- it helps users maintain their own confidence and independence and adapts to invite more family support as it detects life changes. Users and families are provided with links to local support groups- networks and helplines each time change is noted. This provides a personal contact point for peer support- a better insight into current and future needs as well as an outlet for emotional release. A group brainstorm An Individual,0,4,3,5,4,1

From a technology standpoint- Genivity recently brought on a highly-experienced CTO who is leading the way for integrations with other platforms to help scale quickly. Heather leads the vision for Genivity and focuses on product design- business development- and fundraising. She brings a decade of sales- marketing and market development experience to Genivity from her time in the medical device industry working for Medtronic & Abbott Vascular. Feedback on our caregiver experience and help with how to display care cost and disability information in a sensitive yet educational way to families. Health care costs are a top fear of pre-retirees and we need help and guidance on how to personalize that information to caregivers so that they prioritize taking care of their health and making sure they are also protected financially. Due to the flexible nature of the HALO by Genivity solution- it can be easily scaled to reach large audiences. The solution can be embedded directly on an organization's website (or hosted by Genivity) to give full and immediate access to anyone with the unique URL. HALO by Genivity is a scalable solution that is flexible in its application. As such- HALO is something that employers would implement as part of their wellness programs to enable broad access to our solution. The cost of implementation would fall to organizations and companies as part of their benefits and ongoing care of employees and their families. Over 1 year We measure the impact of HALO for caregivers in several ways: The first metric is usage. We look at how many people are using HALO from a specific organization as well as how many people start the assessment yet never finish. This enables us to understand where we can better improve our experience and how well its being promoted by the organization. The second metric- which relates directly to caregivers- is tracking their immediate next step. Whether with a financial planner or with While many aspects of caregiving have been previously studied- financial caregiving remains largely unexamined. We are currently working with financial advisors who are interested in providing caregiving and care planning solutions to their clients. We want to more closely track results from these planning conversations to show how this risk information helps caregivers save more today for retirement so their own care needs will be covered after caregiving. Caregivers as a group spend $190 billion annually on out-of-pocket- care-related costs- and 66% of them feel they could use financial advice- according to a new Merrill Lynch study. The report finds caregivers on average spend $7-000 on caregiving per year- which goes toward paying for personal- medical and household needs. While Alzheimer’s/dementia caregivers spend- on average- 54% more. Genivity helps caregivers understand and plan early for care costs to help protect their financial future.

Laura is an interaction and service design researcher who loves to research&design in the healthcare domain- Simone is a psychiatrist and researcher at the King’s College in London We would like to know more about how 3d printing communities work online- 3d printing drawing softwares for not designers- home/easy to use 3d printers. We might try a small scale Souvenir service with people in our network: Simone- psychiatrist- as the therapist- Laura as the 3d designer and 3 couples of caregiver +loved one. The designer will observe the Souvenir meeting both for research and for collecting the brief for the object to build. Following the first meeting-we will introduce tools to sketch the fictional objects- so that they can be tried out during the Souvenir meeting. While the ability to recall events of the past collapse around the affected person- therapeutic efforts mainly focus on “scaffolding” and “maintain” existing memories. This leaves caregivers with the solitary responsibility of remembering and preserving the “correct” truth of what it was. Souvenir aims to provide a generative space where caregivers and their beloved ones would recall shared memories to create together new stories and tangible artifacts of them- irrespective of their truthfulness Over 1 year A group brainstorm An Individual,0,4,2,4,4,0

I have collaborated in several projects where we used the design toolkit to structure our ideas. I have also mentored entrepreneurs through different incubator programs! We would benefit greatly from help in our light-weight experiments. Your experience in observation and insight collection can help us pivot our idea and structure it to the needs of our market. Any assistance through out the process is valuable ! We will buy basic plain tshirts and adjust them by attaching them with pieces of velcro. We will then distirbute these t-shirts to different care givers and ask them to test them out with their patients. They will then share their feedback with us so that we can pivot our product as needed. This idea is designed specifically for dementia patients by incorporating pads- convertible wear and comfort. It benefits caregivers by facilitating the process of changing patients by using Velcro in every item. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,2,3,3,3,0

This system is designed for older adults that suffer from dementia-resultant falls. It allows the caregiver to look after the care-recipient remotely and track him as he navigates through the house and keep in touch with him.

Guidance on what additional capabilities are needed to assist those suffering from dementia. How can we make TruSense the go-to solution for those with dementia. Ten months ago we started working with just a few seniors where we had direct access that provided us with first hand observations of their life patterns to be certain the system output matched the real world patterns and accurately identified any anomalies that related to potential safety and wellness issues.More recently we extended to a small group of seniors including a program with an independent living facility that provided additional confirmation of the accuracy of TruSense. TruSense is ideal for caregivers that cannot be with their loved ones every moment as well as older adults that- despite onset of dementia- lead an active lifestyle- and desire the peace of mind that help is a voice command away. It is a true 24/7 experience that is focused on seniors and their needs. Its ability to access help and communicate activity to others- combined with its sleek- discreet design and long battery life- means there is one less thing to worry about. 4 months - 1 year A group brainstorm,0,2,3,3,2,0

I have also worked with vulnerable populations in a variety of positions- including work as a support person for individuals with dementia. The OpenIDEO could provide a lot of collaborative experience to refine out idea. Specifically- we are seeking mentorship surrounding research in community spaces- and would like to connect with researchers or community planners to enhance this arm of our organization. In the future Marlena Books wants to expand our book offerings to intergenerational titles and books in multiple languages- and we are seeking mentorship in areas such a product development- product management and pricing. Testing out ideas in local long term care homes- adult day programs or senior centres would allow us to test the idea on individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Through this we would be able to obtain and analyze feedback- and make improvements in a way that would benefit both individuals with dementia and their care partners.

I also have personal experience helping my family members with dementia. Research into qualifications for state home care assistance outside of California- and tricks needed to qualify for those services. I know California services like the back of my hand. Offer this as a resource to doctors offices to give to families of those diagnosed with dementia- or a major research hub- like UCLA. They could help us track the data and glitches. If a loved one needs to care for someone with dementia- all the answers are there already. But they are scattered and care givers are overwhelmed. This system would have you put in all your information (for example- location and assets effect what services you can obtain)- aggregates the data and puts together a road map for everything you qualify for and templates to implement the care.

We are three Industrial design students at the Technical University of Eindhoven- The Netherlands. Guidementia was our first Master project. The concept won two design challenges and received a lot of positive feedback from both caregivers as well as caretakers. However- as we are in our final master year- we don't have the enough time to continue with the concept. We hope to find the right people to continue with the project in the meanwhile. We have tested the concept with two second stage dementia caretakers with a first prototype (application on a phone)- and analysed why the device might or might not work in context. Secondly- we have the opportunity to make use of the GGZE network- in order to reach caretakers and caregivers. People with dementia- mainly in stage 2/3 CDR.

We have a caregiver- designer- social worker- professor- etc. We'd love feedback all the different items you'd believe are useful forms of support during a caregiver's journey. Practical tools such as information- resources- etc. Identity tools to help with self-discovery and therapy. Community tools to build a sense of belonging and connection. Hilarious tools to bring light-heartedness and fun to each day. We will speak to various caregivers at different stages of the journey to create a comprehensive list of all the types of items/support that they'd like. We will arrange these items in alignment with a general caregiver journey. We will then prototype the items in the first three boxes in the subscription service to see if they are useful. This is designed for new caregivers and the friends/family that support them to navigate their new normal - a life with caregiving. It's a care package delivered once a month with items that align to the caregiver's needs during different stages of the journey. There are 4 categories of items in every box: Practical- Identity- Community- and Hilarious.

3VLL1PIENQ0V5UCK33R69X4UH17ZOR,3VLL1PIENQ0V5UCK33R69X4UH17ZOR, YouthCare is the least expensive respite care that creates in an intergenerational bridge to create three very important outcomes. First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue. Get our program off the ground at USC! In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science. We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture. Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas. The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand. 4 months - 1 year For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors). Our quantity and scale will be measured by the number of low-cost respite care hours we are able to provide. We are already currently running a similar- but grant-funded program- TimeOut@UCLA.In 2 years- TimeOut@UCLA has paired over 100 students and seniors- offering 3000+ hours of care. The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite. YouthCare is designed as a win-win-win situation for caregivers- students- and seniors with Alzheimer’s. Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging. Seniors: helps battle social isolation and creates a setting for purposeful aging via the mentor-mentee rapport that develops between seniors and caregivers. A student collaboration,1,2,3,3,3,1

Prior to moving home to care for my mother- I worked in the non profit sector.Since moving back home and meeting a group of respected physicians & executives in the field- Ive found my entrepreneurial spirit and started Gloria's Way. Support and expertise in fund-raising; app support: - guidance with information technology and application to reach dementia population and care givers- how to use geo fences to alert or find families in the areas in which we work who are on the internet looking for caregiver services (or Im not sure what- but using tech to help the caregiver find us and us them.There is so much on internet that it can get overwhelming). price sensitivity models for elderly population; marketing and promotion. Gloria's Way plans to launch in four bordering communities- creating a dementia-friendly village- the first of its kind in the region.

Once our initial village is up and running- we will spread our umbrella to the surrounding communities/states setting up additional dementia villages.We envision the spread to be done through both physical and tech based tool kits Costs do not depend on more users to cut costs.Costs do not fluctuate.Because we are simply a networking space- once a cost is created- they are not dependent on external market pressures. However- our Over 1 year Through feedback and tracking measures that will assess impact and outreach.For instance:Number of caregivers and family members served within community; Navigation service provided to caregiver and identification of barriers that impact outcomes; Number of referrals to Village network of service providers and volunteers; how many services were used or accessed by caregivers and what was satisfaction with quality and scope of service(s) provided; etc (more to data to be collected) Most of the business and logistical structure- participating businesses and services are in place to conduct an initial pilot within four bordering communities. The plan is to conduct a three-month program during which- measures will be tracked to assess impact- outreach- and success of programs.We also plan to assess tech apps that connect our network members and our supporting staff/volunteers.

3X4Q1O9UBHYCLK6EK8ZNIDBV78V7O8,3X4Q1O9UBHYCLK6EK8ZNIDBV78V7O8, Watch me! Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time. After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me! App worldwide in Google playstore (Android) & App store (iOS) as soon as possible. The PIT team consists of several professionals: - Maaike Thissen - professional caregiver at Pleyade - Rens Brankaert - professor at TU Eindhoven - Serge Offermans - technical & interaction designer - Hugo Nagtzaam - designer - Jaap van den Elzen - designer - Tijmen Stroeken - creative mind We would like to constantly reflect with the community on the steps taken in our iterative design process. Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas. Later- we can find other test locations in the community. The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world. We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them. 0-3 months We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application. The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application. Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me!

It’s called 12 Tiny We’ll-being Tips for Caregivers. It’s visual- unlike most books with a gazillion words that overwhelm the already overwhelmed caregiver. I also have other heart-felt products that will be out in the future - also designed to help Caregivers cope. I continue to work on selling what I have and then applying the profits to buy more cards- books etc... so that I can continue to sell them.We hope to continue traveling- speaking- hugging caregivers and selling my inventory (and giving away some too- of course).:) I've been a life & business visual coach since 2008. Every client walks away with a visual representation of our session together. I'm also a visual facilitator. I draw out each workshop or seminar I offer. I love to create and find that it's the best way to connect with the core of another person. I need help streamlining my ideas.I'm an artist so it's easy to go in a bazillion different directions.I need help creating a sound plan as I expand and offer additional creative- visual tools for caregivers.As mentioned- I'm on a teeny- tiny budget but have so many ideas... another book- organizers- greeting cards- etc... I'm an overwhelmed creative caregiver who needs an ear- a shoulder and an angel to help me see this idea come to life as it truly should. It's just a matter of time (confident I guess).I'm hoping to collaborate with large organizations down the road.I just sent a copy of my book and a few cards to someone at AARP... hoping to gain recognition.I just need to continue to move forward and watch what happens.I am operating from a place of LARGE HOPE.:) OH! I'm also doing guest spots on podcasts and blogs. Over 1 year I get feedback and of course... sales increase from word of mouth- etc... Phone calls asking me to do a workshop/seminar... sharing my story... watching the eyes of those in the audience... etc... I've already sold and given away several of my books.The reviews have been really good (blushing).One thing that I've learned is that when I'm ready to print my next round of books... It'll most likely be a soft cover so that I can give out even more. We've met with caregiver's- given out books- listened to their stories- acknowledged their efforts and hugged them.It's been amazing so far. My book is designed for the overwhelmed caregiver who feels emotionally drained and defeated. As a caregiver- I looked for books that would help. I was overwhelmed and couldn't bring myself to read all of the words in any one of the books I found- so I wrote and illustrated 12 Tiny Well-being Tips for Caregivers. First I tell our story- followed by hands on exercises designed to help caregivers own their reality while acknowledging their own resourcefulness. It's visual- simple and inspiring.

Receive guidance from the OpenIDEO community on concept validation- design/type ofartefacts- packaging of the compassion box and the messaging content. How to make it more visual and digestible and perhaps add a dash of humour. For early experiment- I'd like to talk to caregivers and create a broad overview of the kind of support they need from the community- and the daily struggles they face. Interact with the medical fraternity to find out the most important stuff to include. Do a trial run with 10-15 people around the caregiver- to understand their emotional response to content- to more accurately predict how those emotions translate into action. The Compassion Box focusses on the 'social wellbeing' of the caregivers. It's a toolkit which the caregivers may use to generate awareness & sensitise family- friends- neighbours & other people (shopkeeper vendors- bankers- maids etc.) -who are part of the daily interaction circle of the caregiver & patient's family.It is full of bite-sized yet nuanced information about Dementia in the form of artifacts like accordion leaflets- origami toys- bookmarks- tote bag- flash cards- calendar etc. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,2,4,2,1

I launched a platform called Greater Good- that connects creatives with non-profit organizations and social enterprises in India. Developing an app of this magnitude and ensuring credibility requires collaboration with professionals and experts in the field . To be successful it would be crucial to involve professionals and caregivers at every stage. An opportunity to share the idea with healthcare service providers to gain their perspective would be ideal. More insights on how the app could tie up with hospitals and institutions would be appreciated. Accepting that a loved one has dementia and being the main caregiver can be overwhelming and daunting. With this in mind- Aegis has been designed to assume the role of the silent specialist- assistant and companion. The app is 3 fold - a section which provides information- a care recipient portal and a caregiver portal. From information in sections (based on how far the condition has progressed) to features that assist in making appointments- Aegis supports and streamlines caregiving. 0-3 months An Individual,0,2,2,3,3,0

People are able to reach it be saying “Talk to Digital companion”. It has received 5-star ratings and much interest from across the world. Through this release- we are able to get feedback on the public version. Next- we are trying to identify a facility/ group where we can release the dedicated product- so that both the caregiver and resident communities can benefit from additional features and analysis. This idea is designed for both caregivers and people with dementia who are isolated from the rest of the society. As they go through the challenges of everyday life- they hardly find the same level of compassion and empathy from the rest of the society. In some cases- they even feel isolated in social gatherings. Digital Companion will listen to their emotions- recognize patterns- advise them to seek help.

My idea is designed specifically for the family caregivers so that they become more mentally prepared with the progression of the disease. Many caregivers can handle caring for their loved one aside from the obstacles that interfere. However- as the disease advances to its middle stages where behavior becomes more difficult to handle- caregivers may fall in a state of depression and isolation. Since it is nearly impossible to remove the emotional attachment- caregivers tend to become hopeless. 0-3 months An Individual,0,4,5,4,5,0
3XH7ZM9YX26JWGMNRXEBQ476DL39RV,3XH7ZM9YX26JWGMNRXEBQ476DL39RV, This idea sprang from an interdisciplinary group of experts. Our group had a designer/facilitator- prototyper- social worker and Program & Education Specialist for Alzheimer's Association- healthcare technology industry veteran with over 25 years of management experience- and a music therapist. Feedback and a team to move this idea forward. A clickable prototype for the app and some user testing with the community. Our audience are full-time- part-time- remote family caregivers who need to be encouraged to take time to focus on self-care. 0-3 months A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter,0,2,3,3,3,0

They have backgrounds in architecture- UX design and Alzheimer's research. We are unsure if our approach should be around designing a whole new service or if we should attempt to provide an add-on or extension to an existing service like Uber or Lyft.A few other things we are interested in getting feedback and discussing: -Legal Issues and Liability concerns -Feasibility -Value of specific features We would like to conduct a trial run of our service providing transportation for the father of one of the caregivers we interviewed during research. This will allow us to test the different features of the service and how effectively our solution provides value. Transportation is essential to leading an independent life and driving is one of the first skills that people with dementia lose. We propose an on-demand transportation service tailored to the needs of people with dementia. This will reduce the burden on caregivers to provide transportation. Additionally- it will extend a sense of independence for people in early stages of the disease. 4 months - 1 year A student collaboration,0,3,3,3,3,1

3YLPJ8OXX8P2W62NJ1OCYEIESAA4XQ,3YLPJ8OXX8P2W62NJ1OCYEIESAA4XQ, I'm a strategist/researcher for a branding and innovation company who is passionate about social issues. I love my grandmother who has Alzheimer's disease and my mother who cares for her. The intention behind Hello Rita! is to balance the soft skills of story telling with research backed methods. We would like help developing the guide- and getting connections to doctors who can speak specifically to care plans. We would love to connect to folks who are current practitioners of homemade orientation and memory books. We could go draft up a conversation guide on paper (as opposed to the full online system) and ask for caregivers’ input. Hello Rita! is designed with both the caregiver and the individual with dementia in mind.Throughout the process of creating the photo book- on-screen prompts guide the caregiver through uploading photos and having meaningful conversations with their loved one with dementia. Reflective conversations are interspersed with tactical care planning prompts. The resulting photo books serve as comforting momentos for the individual with dementia whenever they feel disconnected or lost. 0-3 months A group brainstorm,0,3,4,4,3,0
3ZLW647WAL7GDUGMVYY0YJWC11D23S,3ZLW647WAL7GDUGMVYY0YJWC11D23S, The team engages expertise of faculty in nursing- medicine- pharmacy and allied health professions- as well as health care providers and community partners.This is the first “app” built by the team- employing a UI/UX designer- programmers- and private sector technical and business advisors. Primarily- our team needs help in: 1) Efficient marketing / raising awareness for the tool so people can find it; 2) Developing a revenue model that will support the application (hosting- technical support- content review / updating); and 3) Exploring partnerships or organizational structures to maintain the app in the future.Additionally- if the tool can be leveraged to provide additional features or value to the community- we would love to consider those ideas in future versions. Private grant funding has supported us to build a prototype app and we are currently concluding a pilot test with 50 individual caregivers- with plans for a 2nd pilot in Spring of 2018.We would be excited to expand the testing/feedback of the application with commercial or strategic partners- ideally in conjunction with evaluating potential business models. Adult children with paid employment caring for parent or in-law; newer to caregiving or just starting to have questions. Agefully develops skills important to any caregiver- while addressing concerns specific or especially relevant to those helping people with dementia- including driving- financial exploitation- communication strategies and decision-making. Agefully also helps users understand the caregiver role and how it may change- to encourage self-care and use of supports. Over 1 year An Individual,0,2,3,4,3,0
3ZURAPD288Z44LEJWPZOU9B4CL4F1X,3ZURAPD288Z44LEJWPZOU9B4CL4F1X, I've been a graphic designer working in healthcare- but also on children's books- game design as teaching aids and exhibitions. I've had many requests for different language versions- so I need help with this. I'd like to try it out with different languages and communities. Originally designed for use in Care Homes- but used extensively by families and carers at home and in many different settings. It opens up conversations- gets connections made- makes the person with dementia feel loved- cared for and special. You will never run out of things to talk about whilst learning about each other and creating stronger bonds. Enjoyed by all the family from about five years old. Great for creating fun and laughter as people relax and memories are recalled. Over 1 year An Individual,0,2,4,4,3,0
3ZXNP4Z39RX4FZ3H7GJVQW71C3Q7LR,3ZXNP4Z39RX4FZ3H7GJVQW71C3Q7LR, Cathy Braxton and Tami Neumann (founders of Silver Dawn Training Institute) have collectively spent over 40 years in the long term care industry within various capacities.As published authors and a member organization with the Alzheimer's Foundation of America- they are a catalyst for change. The OpenIDEO community would be integral in assisting forwarding the DCE Program by reaching out to community organizations that have a large pool of family caregivers. This can include nursing homes- assisted livings- hospitals- support group settings- church and community groups.Additionally the Start with Yes DCE Program would be enhanced by a simplistic and streamlined online classroom platform process- making all of the information and interactions frustration free. Silver Dawn Training Institute has utilized a similar training program- called the Certified Dementia Communication Specialist (CDCS) for professional caregivers within the past 12 months.A total of 61 personal and professional caregivers have earned their CDCS certification and rated the course as one of the most effective and impactful dementia education classes that have changed the way they interact with clients- co-workers and their own family members. Designed for caregivers (regardless of age or education level)- the four pillars of empathy- four basic rules of improv and introspective activities are combined to create a simple yet profound communication approach that can be used to create peak moments of success with anyone- encouraging intentional communication strategies to become a lifestyle choice. 4 months - 1 year A group brainstorm,0,2,1,4,4,0
