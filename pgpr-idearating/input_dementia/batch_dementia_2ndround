Through a co-development process- we will incorporate findings from different cultural groups to evolve Hivemind to be flexible & culturally relevant to diverse- underserved communities. From there- we will roll out the mentorship program with established partners before releasing it as open-source to all.The outreach/recruitment for the “mentor pool” can be scaled via assisted living facilities and memory centers.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Hivemind seeks to augment the efforts of nonprofits and facilitate more access to mentorship and support. Nonprofit operators will scale from Hivemind framework of templates- processes- and platforms. - Nonprofit personnel costs are only 1-2 hours per week or month. - Responsive website (accessible for all devices) will be paid for by donations. - Mentor are unpaid volunteers.

I have also been testing the app with individual family caregivers who are caring for a loved one with dementia. I hope to continue pilot testing the app and gathering research data that demonstrates GreyMatters' positive effects on quality of life for both patients and caregivers.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>GreyMatters was designed to improve daily life for both family caregivers and their loved ones with dementia. GreyMatters helps to relieve caregiver stress by keeping loved ones with dementia engaged in a meaningful way- which in turn reduces negative behaviors and improves mood.

Of course- bringing widespread awareness of our initiative using OpenIDEO’s various powerful social media platforms will be very helpful in extending the project scope and seeking industry partnerships that could ensure its success.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We completed an initial feasibility study (n=56- three sites) validating the use of VR among people with dementia when administered by researchers in a controlled environment. Given the positive findings- we improved the VR-therapy and are ready to evaluate it with larger target patient population- engaging caregivers through joint participation in the study. We intend to evaluate the process of administering the VR therapy by formal/ informal caregivers- and people with dementia themselves.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our goal is to reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia that contribute to caregiver burnout and often result in the institutionalization of a loved one. We have created a library of VR “experiences” (e.g. calm lake- tranquil garden) that aim to stimulate psychological/cognitive health by decreasing depression- anxiety- and aggression and reducing wandering. This approach is less costly and more dignified than many current practices (e.g. neuroleptic drugs/restraints).</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,5,It would depend on if it showed results or not.,I think using a VR to help dementia patients is a great idea that people would want to try out.,"If it actually works and helps people, this could be a breakthrough for patients.",4,4,4,4,4

This is a spinoff of an idea generated at an OpenIdeo Workshop -- posted here as GERI: Virtual Assistant for Caregivers.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>What organizations are already encouraging artwork by caregivers? How is that going? The National Center for Creative Aging has a Creative Caregiving initiative. Caregiver.com hosts an annual Caregiving Art Show. Who else is doing something similar or complementary? How would we find artists and writers to give mini-lessons? Would the site need to be private- for registered users only- to encourage amateur submissions?Should we allow people to connect with others by commenting on their work?</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Perhaps we would start with writing classes and art classes for adults. These classes attract older people- many of whom would likely have caregiving experience.If we could find a way to give these people an assignment -- e.g.- express your caregiving experience via the artistic medium you're already exploring -- we could begin to assess proof of concept. Asking a random busy caregiver to express herself artistically might be tougher- but photography could be an easy entry point.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>We think of caregivers as stressed and depressed. This project flips that script- elevating caregiving to an experience that naturally generates and benefits from creative expression.This online portal provides a peaceful- inspiring- validating place caregivers can go to any time of day or night to see their experience reflected in others' artwork -- and upload their own creations- however amateur. The message: Caregivers are artists- each with their own stories to tell.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter An Individual</p>,5,I don't foresee any problems happening with this idea.,I think people of all ages would still want to express themselves through art.,The idea seems really possible to do in a simple way as well.,5,5,5,5,5

In my masters degree- I worked directly with elders and people with dementia. Apart from that- I've also worked as a waiter.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Experience with elders and people with dementia will always be a great input for the project. Since every case is different- sharing experiences people have had can potentially bring both new problems and solutions to the table- that might help the product improve. Also- different backgrounds and cultures may provide new ideas for similar approaches using different products or activities.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Although the idea has been tried and tested- each person has a unique story and experience- and very particular level of ability. More so for people with dementia- where every case is a unique case.In this sense- improvements and adaptations can allways be made. At this stage- a really interesting next step for the project would be to explore more ways to stimulate creativity through the loom- as well as ways to involve more people around it.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Tear (portuguese for loom)- is designed to help elders and people with dementia stay active- stimulated- motivated- included and creative. Weaving is something most elders know and like- so taking advantage of that- a loom was created that compensates for many impairments associated with old age and dementia- both physically and mentally. It allows elders to prove to others- but most important- to themselves- that they are still able.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p>,5,"It would be viable to use long term, a loom isn't that hard to make for dementia patients.",This will help dementia patients keep their brains active.  I think a lot of family members will want to try it out with their loved one.,"i think it's highly feasible to implement an idea like this, especially it if helps dementia patients learn new things.",5,5,5,5,5

Since then- high-fidelity prototypes have been designed and we'd like to continue more rounds of user testing with caregivers in the community to enhance the user experience.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Herd is a tool specifically designed for family caregivers. While caregiving resources are plentiful- it was discovered that online support resources for caregivers were- at times- difficult to find or navigate. Response times to questions ranged and questions sometimes received only a few responses- which varied in terms of relevancy or helpfulness. The goal is to alleviate caregiver stress by reducing wait times while increasing relevancy & helpfulness of responses to caregiver questions.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>An Individual</p>,2,I think this could reach a lot of caregivers.,"I don't really think caregivers would be into this, it seems like something they could do on their own.","It would be easy to pull off, if the desire is there.",4,3,4,4,4

Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our idea is designed to help family caregivers understand how Alzheimer's affects the brain- and how that translates into progressive loss of many different functions -- not just memory- but also emotions- attention- communication- facial recognition- auditory processing- and spatial awareness. The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm A student collaboration An Individual</p>,4,"Depending on the long term effects on dementia patients, this could be a good option for care.",This is an excellent option for people with family members who have dementia.  I could see lots of families willing to test it out.,It is certainly interesting territory and I think it's a great way for dementia patients to still experience things they love to do.,4,4,4,4,4

Isolation can be a major driver that increases the effects of dementia.We are working on a digital solution to keep them connected with their families and loved ones</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Conpago will continue to refine the Companion in order to give end users the best experience possible. We will look continue to look for funding so that we can push this product to the international market. Conpago aims to alleviate the burdens that caregivers have by implementing any new innovations that appear in the world of tech- whilst ensuring people with dementia maintain a good standard of living by allowing them to have as much independence for as long as possible.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Our ever expanding team has an array of experience from health and fitness- software engineering- user experience- business and design. We all share a passion for innovation and problem solving. We work closely with professionals from the aged care sector find their sore points and create solutions.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We see OpenIDEO as a great platform to bring to light many of the issues faced by this community- and in doing so- provide a network of like minded people to help create solutions- enable aging in place- and break down the stigma of aging.The greater community will see long term benefits as well- with a load taken off healthcare systems and aged care providers as the solutions created off the back of this program begin to alleviate people's dependence- and provides them with autonomy</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Conpago Companion will have corresponding apps downloadable on any iOS or Android device- allowing any number of caregivers or family members to interact with the dementia patient. This device can be effective for caregivers with loved ones at an early stage of dementia- allowing for ageing in place through the device's passive monitoring ability. This same device has already caught the attention of nursing homes aiming to a reduce invasive checkups on their permanent residential patients.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Conpago has redesigned the Companion in order to achieve greater accessibility for caregivers. The Conpago Companion now fits any existing tablet available on the market. This lowers the cost to caregiver and dementia sufferer. Through the new design- we have been able reduced the cost by 50%- allowing greater affordability to end users.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Conpago is focusing heavily on the user feedback from end users- especially caregivers of individuals the early to mid stages of dementia. This is the primary way we plan to measure the impact of our idea- since our goals are aimed towards assisting caregivers. The secondary way of measuring the impact of our idea is the increase of independence given to caregivers by using the Conpago Companion- through the use of task distribution through the Conpago app.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have been working on ourfunctional prototype and have established connections with two large aged care providers to help test our prototypes and find out how effective they are.We are working closely with these two aged care providers in South East Queensland as well as a research team at the Queensland University of Technology to run user testing and feedback sessions with elderly users to sculpt the product into something that will be easily adopted.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Our product is designed for an entire family network to use with the key beneficiaries being the primary caregivers and elderly user. It is a way to enable passive communication using existing daily routines- or habituated appliances such as a kettle. Because it uses existing routines it can also be a reliable way of passively monitoring if an elderly user has been active.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,5,It seems like an app that has easy upkeep and will stay up for a long time.,I think even young people fear they will end up old and alone so this app will help alleviate this worry.,It seems like an already well designed app.,5,5,5,5,5

I know California services like the back of my hand.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Offer this as a resource to doctors offices to give to families of those diagnosed with dementia- or a major research hub- like UCLA. They could help us track the data and glitches.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>If a loved one needs to care for someone with dementia- all the answers are there already. But they are scattered and care givers are overwhelmed. This system would have you put in all your information (for example- location and assets effect what services you can obtain)- aggregates the data and puts together a road map for everything you qualify for and templates to implement the care. This instantly takes someone one from fear to familiarity.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,5,Families will be in need of this information of years to come so it is a viable idea.,"I definitely think this is needed for families of dementia patients, it does all seem overwhelming.",It seems like it's feasible if you can gather all the necessary information for the families.,5,5,5,5,5

Guidementia was our first Master project. The concept won two design challenges and received a lot of positive feedback from both caregivers as well as caretakers. However- as we are in our final master year- we don't have the enough time to continue with the concept. We hope to find the right people to continue with the project in the meanwhile.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have tested the concept with two second stage dementia caretakers with a first prototype (application on a phone)- and analysed why the device might or might not work in context.

With this challenge I notice how important is not only for me. I have some parts that I want to improve- like design- make a database- specialist- geriatrics- and all the people that can believe and want to work for this challenge.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Working on differents meetups about tecnologies- startups- and more. I always talk and ask people about this with a resume about my project- and they give me feedback about things that in some cases I ever think. Some people also told me different cases in their families- but all of them have the same question: What they can do; which are the signs if someone has senile dementia. That's the reason why I want this project to be real. My project can help them to find a tool to bear it.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>This app is develop thinking on the relatives that have to take care to elderly relatives. It is designed to help to know about the signs- the clues and the symptoms that can help them to have the  right diagnosis earlier than espected.

We have a caregiver- designer- social worker- professor- etc.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We'd love feedback all the different items you'd believe are useful forms of support during a caregiver's journey. Practical tools such as information- resources- etc. Identity tools to help with self-discovery and therapy. Community tools to build a sense of belonging and connection. Hilarious tools to bring light-heartedness and fun to each day.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We will speak to various caregivers at different stages of the journey to create a comprehensive list of all the types of items/support that they'd like. We will arrange these items in alignment with a general caregiver journey. We will then prototype the items in the first three boxes in the subscription service to see if they are useful.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>This is designed for new caregivers and the friends/family that support them to navigate their new normal - a life with caregiving. It's a care package delivered once a month with items that align to the caregiver's needs during different stages of the journey. There are 4 categories of items in every box: Practical- Identity- Community- and Hilarious. These packages can be purchased as a subscription by the caregiver themselves- or as a gift from friends who want to help but don't know how.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter</p>,3,I think the categories are a nice touch.

First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Get our program off the ground at USC!</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors). Our quantity and scale will be measured by the number of low-cost respite care hours we are able to provide.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are already currently running a similar- but grant-funded program- TimeOut@UCLA.In 2 years- TimeOut@UCLA has paired over 100 students and seniors- offering 3000+ hours of care. The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>YouthCare is designed as a win-win-win situation for caregivers- students- and seniors with Alzheimer’s. Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging. Seniors: helps battle social isolation and creates a setting for purposeful aging via the mentor-mentee rapport that develops between seniors and caregivers.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p>,5,"Since it is so wide-reaching, I think that is a good sign about how viable it is.",This is definitely something that a lot of people would benefit from.,"It seems like you already have this off the ground and running, which is great.",5,5,5,5,5

Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me! App worldwide in Google playstore (Android) & App store (iOS) as soon as possible.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>The PIT team consists of several professionals: - Maaike Thissen - professional caregiver at Pleyade - Rens Brankaert - professor at TU Eindhoven - Serge Offermans - technical & interaction designer - Hugo Nagtzaam - designer - Jaap van den Elzen - designer - Tijmen Stroeken - creative mind</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We would like to constantly reflect with the community on the steps taken in our iterative design process. Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas. Later- we can find other test locations in the community.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me! Appthereby provides the opportunity for the caregiver to have more quality time with their loved one or for themselves.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,5,"The viability of the idea depends upon the successful functioning of the app to provide good support to the user, the idea itself gives a hope for a demantia person to be independent, so demand for such apps is huge, if the app is technically good at functioning it would receive a great success.","It introduce the Watch me app which make the people suffering from demantia independent, the desire for such app makes peoples life better.","As the application design and process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining of the app is conducted by experts and include the online platform for feedback from the (user) community, it can get a technical feasibility, on economic terms the app is proposed to provide free for android and apple users to analize the data for further research.",3,4,4,4,4

Many caregivers can handle caring for their loved one aside from the obstacles that interfere. However- as the disease advances to its middle stages where behavior becomes more difficult to handle- caregivers may fall in a state of depression and isolation.

All content has been derived from scientific literature and validated with experts. The serious game has been tested in four focus groups of informal caregivers. Dementia stakeholders in Belgium have confirmed the need of such a tool.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our immediate next steps are to finalize the e-learning and integrate the package into an online environment. This will be carried out in close collaboration with Flemish dementia experts. We have submitted a grant application in Belgium and expect to receive an update in Q1 2018.

Due to the complexity in healthcare and the robust number of stakeholders involved it's not clear as to the best route that we can take to get this tool into the hands of end users. That being said- we have finalized a plan for the European market in collaboration with dementia stakeholders in Flanders- Belgium.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We have a clear plan for scalability in Flanders- which will serve as proof-of-concept for other regions. As dementia advocacy and support groups operate at regional levels- we will focus on marketing MIB Coping Dementia to regional groups such as Alzheimer's Society- Alzheimer's Association- etc. We have well-established connections with such groups outside of Belgium and plan to move into new European countries each year starting in 2019. We will initiate a simultaneous plan for North America.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We expect that MIB Coping Dementia will be provided to end users at no- or minimal- cost. Our intention is to license the tool to regional dementia patient and caregiver networks focusing on established family groups. Two elements that will facilitate this is the low barrier for moderators and the forthcoming online accessibility. This will ensure that MIB Coping Dementia is accessible to all those that wish to attend an in-person session or use it independently at home.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>The impact of our idea can be measured at a personal level by integrating questionnaires into the tool and analyzing outcomes over time. Alternatively it could be measured at the regional level by evaluating pooled user data such as: number of users- times accessed- outcomes- etc.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>This idea has already been evaluated through several focus groups of caregivers of individuals with dementia in Flanders- Belgium and was also evaluated by several clinicians as part of a masters thesis at the University of Leuven in Belgium. These initial focus groups provided excellent input from the target audience into the needs and expectations for such a tool. Additional focus groups could also be carried out in other jurisdictions where the company operates- such as North America.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>The idea is designed for caregivers of loved ones with dementia and it provides support to these individuals by both educating and empowering them. Education is provided through an e-learning component and cognitive feedback offered during the scenario-based serious game. Additionally- the scenario-based tool offers a safe- virtual environment where caregivers can test coping strategies and experience the implications of their actions in realistic and recognizable scenarios.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p>","4","I think it could succeed as it could appeal to a large range of people.","It helps caregivers to learn and cope in a modern manner, but in person groups area also available for those who need them.","it seems like the technology for this exists.","4","4","4"

Find out any issues they have with implementing or fundraising for this idea and gauge their general opinion of this research concept.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>This idea is catered towards caregivers feeling isolated. According to a study (Farrell M.T 2014) people with dementia were excluded from neighborhoods due to their reduced ability to follow social engagement rules. This increased caregiver burden as their loved ones with dementia experienced social withdrawal symptoms. According to a study (Duffin C 2014)- the Neighborhood Friendly Movement has helped relieve the stress of caregivers by helping local neighborhoods redesign their open spaces.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>An Individual</p>","5","A lot of funding would be needed to keep it going.","This seems like an attractive idea that would transform neighborhoods.","This idea seems to need a lot of funding.","3","3","3"

Moving forward- word of mouth via local support groups and aid circles among alzheimer’s patients’ families will help keep the customer base growing.

We plan to incentivize volunteer caregivers in the final version of this app to ensure that anyone can find care on their schedule- regardless of their financial condition.

To discover the impact of our services- we will ask family caregivers to answer questions (tension index) in the beginning to monitor tension and stress levels. We can periodically monitor and track responses to these surveys and compare it to the initial benchmark to measure effectiveness of the platform as a means to improve their experience.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We can launch an alpha version of this app with a small group of volunteers and primary caregivers that we know to better understand how we can tweak the model and add additional functionality.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>The idea is designed for the primary family caregiver. Taking care of a loved one with dementia can be very time consuming and emotionally taxing.

Moving forward- word of mouth via local support groups and aid circles among alzheimer’s patients’ families will help keep the customer base growing. Our research demonstrated that this app is about as easy to use as Uber- which is a service that has scaled to millions of users around the world.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The application is entirely free for family caregivers and family members willing to help; those two demographics should enable the platform to get scale. We plan to incentivize volunteer caregivers in the final version of this app to ensure that anyone can find care on their schedule- regardless of their financial condition. Only if a caregiver opts for a professional help will they be charged. A portion of this will be used to continue updating and extending the app.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>The key objective is to protect free-time for the family caregivers inproblematic moments- regardless of their pocket size. To discover the impact of our services- we will ask family caregivers to answer questions (tension index) in the beginning to monitor tension and stress levels. We can periodically monitor and track responses to these surveys and compare it to the initial benchmark to measure effectiveness of the platform as a means to improve their experience.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We can launch an alpha version of this app with a small group of volunteers and primary caregivers that we know to better understand how we can tweak the model and add additional functionality.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>The idea is designed for the primary family caregiver. Taking care of a loved one with dementia can be very time consuming and emotionally taxing. ShareCare gives primary family caregivers the ability to step away for a few hours either to manage other tasks in their lives- or simply to take a break from the strain that care-taking may be causing.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm A student collaboration</p>","5","I think it's a well thought out idea that would be updated over time.","This project seems it would help caregivers to reduce stress.","Funding seems feasible since a lot of it would be through volunteers. The technology would be what is already out there.","5","4","4"

This is a spinoff of an idea generated at an OpenIdeo Workshop -- posted here as GERI: Virtual Assistant for Caregivers.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>What organizations are already encouraging artwork by caregivers? How is that going? The National Center for Creative Aging has a Creative Caregiving initiative. Caregiver.com hosts an annual Caregiving Art Show. Who else is doing something similar or complementary? How would we find artists and writers to give mini-lessons? Would the site need to be private- for registered users only- to encourage amateur submissions?Should we allow people to connect with others by commenting on their work?</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Perhaps we would start with writing classes and art classes for adults. These classes attract older people- many of whom would likely have caregiving experience.If we could find a way to give these people an assignment -- e.g.- express your caregiving experience via the artistic medium you're already exploring -- we could begin to assess proof of concept.

Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free.

What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school.

We have diverse professional backgrounds between us- including work in healthcare and wellness.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We'd appreciate any help that gets us closer to not only bringing this project to life- but improves the system and experience we are proposing. We'd also love to hear about the community's experience providing care with the help of music. Also we're eager to find technologies that can enable the seamless interaction between the people and the music at just the right moment.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Remind is a system that includes both a device and software- but we plan to design a version of the ios and android app that can be used without our music player- but instead using existing personal devices- speakers- and headphones. The concept can not include some of the features but will be scalable as long as there is music. We will educate people on how to use it through the website.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Throughout our design process we have prioritized solving usability issues that people face- such as loss of dexterity- poor vision- etc. Concerning accessibility in terms of cost- organizations such as Music and Memory are dedicated to the efforts of sourcing and distributing mp3 players- as well as recruiting volunteers. We aim to keep our price below the ones they currently use- to make our Remind system an opportunity for everyone.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>By observing people use it- as well as feedback- stories from caregivers and nursing home workers on their experiences using the music system with their care-recipient. Since this an emotional topic- we want to provide a space for users to share the success and challenges they have in an open forum- to help them help each other strengthen their relationships while spreading awareness of Remind.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have evidence that proves the concept could work for some and we want to dedicate more time to using music to try to awaken memories with individuals across various stages of Alzheimer's- and together with caregivers and at nursing homes. We also feel the design of both the app and tangible music player needs to be refined for both the caregiver and person living with Alzheimer's respectively- therefore we would continue crafting and testing mockups and prototypes until it's good enough.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Remind is designed for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers. Patients are connected with their families through a personalized music device and mobile application.

Practical tools such as information- resources- etc. Identity tools to help with self-discovery and therapy. Community tools to build a sense of belonging and connection. Hilarious tools to bring light-heartedness and fun to each day.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We will speak to various caregivers at different stages of the journey to create a comprehensive list of all the types of items/support that they'd like. We will arrange these items in alignment with a general caregiver journey. We will then prototype the items in the first three boxes in the subscription service to see if they are useful.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>This is designed for new caregivers and the friends/family that support them to navigate their new normal - a life with caregiving. It's a care package delivered once a month with items that align to the caregiver's needs during different stages of the journey. There are 4 categories of items in every box: Practical- Identity- Community- and Hilarious.

App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application.
