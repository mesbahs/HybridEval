 12 Tiny Well-being Tips for Caregivers is a visual workbook designed to remind caregivers to care for themselves as they care for others.  My book is designed for the overwhelmed caregiver who feels emotionally drained and defeated. As a caregiver- I looked for books that would help. I was overwhelmed and couldn't bring myself to read all of the words in any one of the books I found- so I wrote and illustrated 12 Tiny Well-being Tips for Caregivers. First I tell our story- followed by hands on exercises designed to help caregivers own their reality while acknowledging their own resourcefulness. It's visual- simple and inspiring.  I've already sold and given away several of my books.The reviews have been really good (blushing).One thing that I've learned is that when I'm ready to print my next round of books... It'll most likely be a soft cover so that I can give out even more. We've met with caregiver's- given out books- listened to their stories- acknowledged their efforts and hugged them.It's been amazing so far.  I need help streamlining my ideas.I'm an artist so it's easy to go in a bazillion different directions.I need help creating a sound plan as I expand and offer additional creative- visual tools for caregivers.As mentioned- I'm on a teeny- tiny budget but have so many ideas... another book- organizers- greeting cards- etc... I'm an overwhelmed creative caregiver who needs an ear- a shoulder and an angel to help me see this idea come to life as it truly should.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  I've been a life & business visual coach since 2008. Every client walks away with a visual representation of our session together. I'm also a visual facilitator. I draw out each workshop or seminar I offer. I love to create and find that it's the best way to connect with the core of another person.  I’m Robin Albright and I have a book that helps caregivers remember to take care of themselves as they care for others. It’s called 12 Tiny We’ll-being Tips for Caregivers. It’s visual- unlike most books with a gazillion words that overwhelm the already overwhelmed caregiver. I also have other heart-felt products that will be out in the future - also designed to help Caregivers cope.  It's just a matter of time (confident I guess).I'm hoping to collaborate with large organizations down the road.I just sent a copy of my book and a few cards to someone at AARP... hoping to gain recognition.I just need to continue to move forward and watch what happens.I am operating from a place of LARGE HOPE.:) OH! I'm also doing guest spots on podcasts and blogs.  I get feedback and of course... sales increase from word of mouth- etc... Phone calls asking me to do a workshop/seminar... sharing my story... watching the eyes of those in the audience... etc...  I continue to work on selling what I have and then applying the profits to buy more cards- books etc... so that I can continue to sell them.We hope to continue traveling- speaking- hugging caregivers and selling my inventory (and giving away some too- of course).:) ,0,1

 TruSense is family-friendly smart home technology for seniors that brings assurance to loved ones and helps older adults stay in their homes  TruSense is ideal for caregivers that cannot be with their loved ones every moment as well as older adults that- despite onset of dementia- lead an active lifestyle- and desire the peace of mind that help is a voice command away. It is a true 24/7 experience that is focused on seniors and their needs. Its ability to access help and communicate activity to others- combined with its sleek- discreet design and long battery life- means there is one less thing to worry about.  Ten months ago we started working with just a few seniors where we had direct access that provided us with first hand observations of their life patterns to be certain the system output matched the real world patterns and accurately identified any anomalies that related to potential safety and wellness issues.More recently we extended to a small group of seniors including a program with an independent living facility that provided additional confirmation of the accuracy of TruSense.  Guidance on what additional capabilities are needed to assist those suffering from dementia. How can we make TruSense the go-to solution for those with dementia.  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm  The CEO of TruSense is anentrepreneur that has formed over 20 different companies that served a wide-range purposes and business needs. ,0,0
 Embodying a person with Alzheimer's enables caregivers to understand how the disease affects the brain and behaviors of their loved one.  Our idea is designed to help family caregivers understand how Alzheimer's affects the brain- and how that translates into progressive loss of many different functions -- not just memory- but also emotions- attention- communication- facial recognition- auditory processing- and spatial awareness. The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.  In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents.  Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm A student collaboration An Individual  Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship.  Embodied Labs creates immersive virtual reality experiences that allow family care partners to embody a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain.  Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public.  The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones.  We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?  1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile. ,1,1
 We want to apply new collaboration solutions to empower caregivers to team up- share resources and information and conquer the challenges.  Designed for family or professional caregivers as well as the care recipients. When care-giving- people always forget about their own care. With a team- caregivers and loved one(s) share their time to stay connected - make it both social and as part of a treatment plan for everyone. CareExchange platform by CareXc provides advanced features for people to effortlessly combine physical & emotional care for loved ones and self-calf- and socialize to efficiently leverage the shared time.  We are in the process of planning a trial of our solution with a local senior community residents and their children to understand the difficulties and benefits of using a team approach. Furthermore- we want to get some validation and feedback on the design of the team-work process.  Communication is key in a team-based activity plan.For OpenIDEO community people the following can make this solution stronger as well as increasingly advanced and better going forward: - those who provide advanced communication mechanisms especially those that are instant or the mechanisms that are suitable for different age groups - those who provide content management that can help caregivers' self-care- or better organize CareXC's total care plan - those who provide analytic solutions.

 Create user-friendly dining ware set to help people with dementia increase food intake- maintain dignity- and makecaregiving easier.  I was inspired by my late grandmother who had dementia. She lost her appetite- ate less then she should- tipped over cups very often- and sometimes refused to eat. The new tableware set can be used to assist our loved ones to eat independently and maintain their dignity. Caregivers will be able to spend less time worrying about loved ones not getting enough nutrition- and also be able to spend less time to feed and clean up after them.  I volunteered in several adult day care centers to do first-hand observations on people with dementia. I realize that the key point in making a good product is to design what people want- and not to design what I want. I work with professionals to come up with solutions.  I want to learn how to conduct a good evaluation with solid numbers without bias. How to conduct research properly. I am also looking for more resources to push this project to the next level.

 Our mission is to improve senior health and reduce medical costs through consistent health routine management and care team collaboration.  VitalAlly enables patient- families- and caregivers to collaborate to help seniors remain medically compliant and manage chronic diseases so they don’t become life-threatening. The system consists of 1.) a twice-a-day medical routine with reminders and care team alerts- 2.) tracking and reporting health indicators such as sleep and mood and 3.) unique user experiences. These three items combine to benefit families through lowered medical costs and reduced guilt through collaboration.  We are starting with a 1-month alpha that includes Leslie and her sister tracking and monitoring their mother's health routines. We will then begin a closed beta with 5 families who provide care for a senior with Alzheimer's and Diabetes. The beta will last 3-months as we track metrics and milestones that validate our mission of increased patient medical compliance and collaboration. Lastly- we will monitor the health changes to further prove our methodology works with other families.  We know we need to prove this works with other families. The question is- what are the key metrics to look for? We are currently exploring go-to-market strategies and gaining attention through related topics on social media. We see the OpenIDEO community helping us by identifying strategic partners- identifying future growth techniques- and validating the UX/UI of our mobile app design. Adoption is critical and we know our users need to have an incredible user experience for this to happen.  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  Leslie Errington- 20 years executive experience in startups- life sciences- pharma- big data- and a daughter who created the process backing VitalAlly.

 The personalized Memory Box portrait- games and mementos keeps isolation and loneliness at bay with beautiful and meaningful activity.  The Memory Box is designed to be co-created and used by caregivers and loved ones at any time during early to mid-stages (1-5) of disease and kept by the caregiver as a beautiful celebration of the individual NOT the patient. As social interactions and activity require more of our loved ones they retreat. Isolation- boredom and loneliness quickly settle in. But it can still be a magical time- where even complex things loved long ago are possible. The trick: putting these activities at hand.  Working with local artists- we can create first boxes with caregivers and their loved one then solicit feedback from the family caregiver- care recipient and visitors.

 Creating a network of dementia nonprofits to inspire them to create dementia friendly neighborhoods in their vicinity.  This idea is catered towards caregivers feeling isolated. According to a study (Farrell M.T 2014) people with dementia were excluded from neighborhoods due to their reduced ability to follow social engagement rules. This increased caregiver burden as their loved ones with dementia experienced social withdrawal symptoms. According to a study (Duffin C 2014)- the Neighborhood Friendly Movement has helped relieve the stress of caregivers by helping local neighborhoods redesign their open spaces.  I would talk to my local dementia nonprofit about the idea of a dementia friendly neighborhood and if they have looked into it. Find out any issues they have with implementing or fundraising for this idea and gauge their general opinion of this research concept.  Since my idea is to build a network of dementia nonprofits globally it would help if the community worked together to find nonprofits that work in the field of dementia globally.  0-3 months  An Individual  I am a college student studying statistics in the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

 Connecting caregivers with creative approaches for managing dementia and building a community with other caregivers.  This idea is designed for family caregivers at various points in their caregiving journey. By providing them with an outlet to connect with dementia experts- community-driven answers- and human connections- this concept harvests the successful techniques of caregivers in the myriad situations that arise with dementia to create a body of knowledge that is as human and personal as the caregiver's experience.  Build a small network of family caregivers to seed information about themselves and the unique solutions they hacked during their caregiving experience. Using this information- we will connect caregivers and iterate on what factors play an important role in helping them connect to what they need to meet their family members where they are.  Input and guidance on establishing the algorithm for this information will be helpful- as well as any feedback from community members with first-hand experience as dementia caregiving.

 A mobile cart in the home to keep as many items and tools related to caring organized in one place.  The cart is primarily used for the family caregiver to assist in daily caring activities by keeping everything organized in one place.It also offers a secondary role to support the loved one with dementia to utilize the cart if they are still able to benefit from its accessibility nearby.Lastly- it also allows the family caregiver to prepare the cart ahead of time to be used by any other person supporting in caring responsibilities such as a personal support worker or other family members.  With prototypes in development- we plan to test out a few variations of a Care Cart with actual caregivers and individuals living with dementia.We have already interviewed numerous family caregivers and those with dementia to provide feedback and wants from this cart.This low tech solution will not be difficult to learn from the caregiver or person with dementia.It is their feedback that will be of great value.

 Therapalz makes smart therapeutic companion animals that make caregiving easier for users with memory disorders as well as their caregivers.  Therapalz makes smart therapeutic companion cats and dogs for individuals with memory disorders. The Therapal recreates the animal assisted therapy experience- providing the same experience as interacting with a real therapy cat or dog. To mimic the experience- the Therapal has a constant heartbeat- lifelike sounds- and responds to user interaction with a purr in both our cats and dogs. The Therapal acts an intervention for caregivers to regain control of the caregiving experience.  Therapalz have been designed alongside users with memory disorders as well as their caregivers in both homes and nursing care facilities. To ensure that the Therapal adds value to caregiving experience- we interview caregivers when developing new features- and then cycle-through the user testing process with individuals memory disorders. We can watch the emotions of users- gauging how the Therapal makes them feel when it is introduced to them- and when it responds with a friendly purr.  We are always looking for unique input from present- past- and future caregivers. Whether you are a grandchild or a neighbor of someone with a memory disorder- you know how much the disorder can change the daily life of that individual.

 AI-powered tele-exercise live video platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected and active- and build healthy habits in a fun way.  Our idea is designed for caregivers taking care of a loved one with early and mid-stage dementia. My mother- at age 72- became my caregiver while I was fighting stage IV cancer. During this difficult time- I felt guilty that I made her age a lot- and today I worry more about her as she turns 77- especially recently when I had to take her to the ER and she became hospitalized. This dynamic role shift has enabled me to see how scary and stressful caregiving can be.  We conducted >100 interviews and tested our product in elder centers across SF. Our research revealed two most popular activities in elder centers. 1. music and dance- and 2. cross-generation activities. We are applying for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community fund with two local non-profits to set up a cross-generation program. University AME Zion Church is the oldest African American church in Palo Alto- already offer tech education program. InATalent brings teenagers to dance with seniors.  We were amazed by the data in the design brief- especially the personas provided by IDEO.org- and the journey map provided by AgingWellHub. We are excited to see countless great ideas submitted to the site and already see opportunities for potential collaboration. We are grateful that our favorite company- IDEO- has a similar focus that is so close to our heart. We look forward to benefitting from OpenIDEO’s incredible resources and using them to build out and refine our idea.  Over 1 year  A student collaboration  I have an extensive background in human-centered design for brands like Yahoo- AT&T- VW- and Sony.

Caregiving can be very stressful. Dance4Healing is an AI-powered tele-exercise platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected- increase accessibility to group exercise- and build healthy habits in a fun way. Our mission is to reduce caregivers’ stress- combat isolation- and improve both emotional and physical health by bringing dance- community- and cross-generational support to home care.  Dance4Healing is designed for accessibility with a tiered model. Our target customers are Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly- Medicare Advantage Plans- and Elder Centers. The basic platform with 40 pre-recorded dance videos is $250/month/location. Caregivers can access the platform at elder centers or from home with no charge. Customized content can be created based on their preference to increase engagement. All the programs only need a computer- wifi- and willing participants!  We are working with OnLok to launch a program designed to reduce anxiety and depression for dementia patients and caregivers. We plan to scale to 233 PACE centers nationwide- serving over 40-000 participants. OnLok founded PACE for the government and is internationally recognized as an eldercare leader. PACE also relieves the burden of caregivers by offering breaks that enable them to better focus on their mental and physical health- and allowing them to spend more time with their families.  Impact will be measured by tracking how many classes caregivers attend- how long they dance- which videos they use- and how they feel before and afterwards. Sensor tracking will be implemented via partnership. Clinical measurements like Zarit Burden Scale Short and CESD-10 has been recommended by our clinical partner- Stanford professor Dolores Thompson- expert on reduce stress- anxiety and depression for dementia family caregivers- a 25 year Geropsychologist and NIH funded researcher.  Our next steps are working with partners and potential funders. 1. OnLok- launch an anxiety and depression reduction program for dementia patients/caregivers. 2. Avenidas- start test the program at their centers. 3. RWJF: advised by program officer Michael Painter to apply for pioneer grant. 4. Moore Foundation: encouraged by President Harvey Fineberg to apply for community health grant. 5.

 An online community for small groups of caregivers to anonymously relate- with AI tools to regulate groups and monitor caregiver wellness.  Our work is designed to offer support to support today's caregivers who struggle in isolation. Cognizant of the stigma and physical accessibility issues that keep these individuals from reaching out- our app allows tailored small group support from anywhere- and anytime via text and voice.However- with access- comes the potential for abuse- so our AI tools run on messages to detect the underlying emotions - flagging inappropriate msgs- and detecting when a caregiver may need additional help  1) Look at existing engagement and usage of online platformsand forums (e.g. reddit) as makeshift support groups within the caregiver communities.2) Offer our platform to caregivers and place them in small groups- manually monitoring group conversations while we judge how caregivers react to the platform.3) Analyze existing data from online caregiver support groups with our AI tools to demonstrate both our ability to flag concerning messages- and the need for a technology to do so.  Our application has been used in a wide variety of populations and contexts: from first responders- to substance users- to at-risk high-schoolers.While this is a testament to the robustness of our small group approach- we recognize that dementia caregivers have unique needs themselves.We'd welcome opportunities to collaborate in 1) refining the UI/UX of our app- 2) developing dementia-caregiver specific content to integrate with the platform- and 3) discussing different rollout strategies  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm A student collaboration  Shrenik and Ravi realized this idea initially to help those with mental illness.

 Genivity helps caregivers protect their retirement and care for loved ones by planning financially for health risks & care costs.  Caregivers as a group spend $190 billion annually on out-of-pocket- care-related costs- and 66% of them feel they could use financial advice- according to a new Merrill Lynch study. The report finds caregivers on average spend $7-000 on caregiving per year- which goes toward paying for personal- medical and household needs. While Alzheimer’s/dementia caregivers spend- on average- 54% more. Genivity helps caregivers understand and plan early for care costs to help protect their financial future.  While many aspects of caregiving have been previously studied- financial caregiving remains largely unexamined. We are currently working with financial advisors who are interested in providing caregiving and care planning solutions to their clients. We want to more closely track results from these planning conversations to show how this risk information helps caregivers save more today for retirement so their own care needs will be covered after caregiving.  Feedback on our caregiver experience and help with how to display care cost and disability information in a sensitive yet educational way to families.

She brings a decade of sales- marketing and market development experience to Genivity from her time in the medical device industry working for Medtronic & Abbott Vascular.  We want to make sure no one runs out of money in retirement because of unforeseen medical expenses. Genivity helps caregivers protect themselves financially so they can stay on track with their own retirement planning while still being able to provide and pay for care for their loved one suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia.  HALO by Genivity is a scalable solution that is flexible in its application. As such- HALO is something that employers would implement as part of their wellness programs to enable broad access to our solution. The cost of implementation would fall to organizations and companies as part of their benefits and ongoing care of employees and their families.  Due to the flexible nature of the HALO by Genivity solution- it can be easily scaled to reach large audiences. The solution can be embedded directly on an organization's website (or hosted by Genivity) to give full and immediate access to anyone with the unique URL.  We measure the impact of HALO for caregivers in several ways: The first metric is usage. We look at how many people are using HALO from a specific organization as well as how many people start the assessment yet never finish. This enables us to understand where we can better improve our experience and how well its being promoted by the organization. The second metric- which relates directly to caregivers- is tracking their immediate next step.

 An online e-learning and scenario-based serious game to empower and educate caregivers of loved ones with dementia.  The idea is designed for caregivers of loved ones with dementia and it provides support to these individuals by both educating and empowering them. Education is provided through an e-learning component and cognitive feedback offered during the scenario-based serious game. Additionally- the scenario-based tool offers a safe- virtual environment where caregivers can test coping strategies and experience the implications of their actions in realistic and recognizable scenarios.  This idea has already been evaluated through several focus groups of caregivers of individuals with dementia in Flanders- Belgium and was also evaluated by several clinicians as part of a masters thesis at the University of Leuven in Belgium. These initial focus groups provided excellent input from the target audience into the needs and expectations for such a tool. Additional focus groups could also be carried out in other jurisdictions where the company operates- such as North America.  The most interesting input from the OpenIDEO community would be related to how can we bring this evidence-based educational tool from demo stage to the market. Due to the complexity in healthcare and the robust number of stakeholders involved it's not clear as to the best route that we can take to get this tool into the hands of end users. That being said- we have finalized a plan for the European market in collaboration with dementia stakeholders in Flanders- Belgium.  Over 1 year  A student collaboration  My background is healthcare - I spent 3 years working in clinical trial management of large-scale clincial trials before shifting gears to my current position. In my current role of Scientific Integration Expert I ensure that scientific evidence is translated into our educational tools.  MindBytes is developing an evidence-based educational tool that consists of a scenario-based serious game and an e-learning to reduce burden of informal caregivers. All content has been derived from scientific literature and validated with experts. The serious game has been tested in four focus groups of informal caregivers. Dementia stakeholders in Belgium have confirmed the need of such a tool.  We expect that MIB Coping Dementia will be provided to end users at no- or minimal- cost. Our intention is to license the tool to regional dementia patient and caregiver networks focusing on established family groups. Two elements that will facilitate this is the low barrier for moderators and the forthcoming online accessibility. This will ensure that MIB Coping Dementia is accessible to all those that wish to attend an in-person session or use it independently at home.  We have a clear plan for scalability in Flanders- which will serve as proof-of-concept for other regions. As dementia advocacy and support groups operate at regional levels- we will focus on marketing MIB Coping Dementia to regional groups such as Alzheimer's Society- Alzheimer's Association- etc. We have well-established connections with such groups outside of Belgium and plan to move into new European countries each year starting in 2019. We will initiate a simultaneous plan for North America.  The impact of our idea can be measured at a personal level by integrating questionnaires into the tool and analyzing outcomes over time. Alternatively it could be measured at the regional level by evaluating pooled user data such as: number of users- times accessed- outcomes- etc.  Our immediate next steps are to finalize the e-learning and integrate the package into an online environment. This will be carried out in close collaboration with Flemish dementia experts. We have submitted a grant application in Belgium and expect to receive an update in Q1 2018. The intention is to launch the finalized version in September 2018 in collaboration with the dementia stakeholders who are already onboard (clinicians- academics- government- advocacy- healthcare funds- etc.). ,0,1
 Through a “build your own adventure” narrative story- patients and caregivers can communicate to each other.  This is designed for family caregivers- who participate in the experience learn about their loved ones emotional state and level of receptiveness. Then- this helps them understand their current emotional state and- therefore- give better emotional care. This will help caregivers feel less frustrated about the conflicting messages they get from the patients. .  We can print a few test copies and distribute them to some primary caregivers to gauge their responses.  Publishing- editing and writing of some additional stories that add to the sequence and design language would best add to idea.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm A student collaboration  Our team has a diverse background with members that have been healthcare consultants- software designers and healthcare researchers.

 Updated 12/26/17 (uploaded new home page pic w/condensed menu bar & p/user feedback- added a tagline- updated doc/videos)  Gloria's Way memory care- http://www.gloriaswaymc.org- is designed for 1) individuals living with early stage dementia- their caregivers and families.Specifically families who need help with caring for their loved one but do not have the means to afford the current high costs of care and are not applicable for low income subsidies;2) Community residents and business owners.  Most of the business and logistical structure- participating businesses and services are in place to conduct an initial pilot within four bordering communities. The plan is to conduct a three-month program during which- measures will be tracked to assess impact- outreach- and success of programs.We also plan to assess tech apps that connect our network members and our supporting staff/volunteers.  Support and expertise in fund-raising; app support: - guidance with information technology and application to reach dementia population and care givers- how to use geo fences to alert or find families in the areas in which we work who are on the internet looking for caregiver services (or Im not sure what- but using tech to help the caregiver find us and us them.There is so much on internet that it can get overwhelming). price sensitivity models for elderly population; marketing and promotion.  Over 1 year  An Individual  Prior to moving home to care for my mother- I worked in the non profit sector.Since moving back home and meeting a group of respected physicians & executives in the field- Ive found my entrepreneurial spirit and started Gloria's Way.  Costs do not depend on more users to cut costs.Costs do not fluctuate.Because we are simply a networking space- once a cost is created- they are not dependent on external market pressures. However- our  Gloria's Way plans to launch in four bordering communities- creating a dementia-friendly village- the first of its kind in the region. However- the need extends far beyond.Gloria's Way has great potential for growth- and the demand for its services is widespread. Once our initial village is up and running- we will spread our umbrella to the surrounding communities/states setting up additional dementia villages.We envision the spread to be done through both physical and tech based tool kits  Through feedback and tracking measures that will assess impact and outreach.For instance:Number of caregivers and family members served within community; Navigation service provided to caregiver and identification of barriers that impact outcomes; Number of referrals to Village network of service providers and volunteers; how many services were used or accessed by caregivers and what was satisfaction with quality and scope of service(s) provided; etc (more to data to be collected)  Take ideas offered from the IDEO community- results from our prototypes and implement them into our pilot program. ,0,1
 ShareCare provides a channel for primary caretakers to seek assistance in watching over their loved ones for a few hours.  The idea is designed for the primary family caregiver. Taking care of a loved one with dementia can be very time consuming and emotionally taxing. ShareCare gives primary family caregivers the ability to step away for a few hours either to manage other tasks in their lives- or simply to take a break from the strain that care-taking may be causing.  We can launch an alpha version of this app with a small group of volunteers and primary caregivers that we know to better understand how we can tweak the model and add additional functionality.  Volunteers are motivated by the rewards system. We can assemble OpenIDEO community business leaders to submit rewards on behalf of their companies and organizations- which will not only incentivize volunteer caregivers- but also provide a prime marketing opportunity for them.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm A student collaboration  Our team has a diverse background with members that have been healthcare consultants- software designers and healthcare researchers. A majority of our team is now enrolled full-time in the design masters/MBA program at Northwestern-Kellogg University.  ShareCare allows primary care givers to schedule help from their family and friends or from a selection of background checked professionals. Top floor please!  The application is entirely free for family caregivers and family members willing to help; those two demographics should enable the platform to get scale. We plan to incentivize volunteer caregivers in the final version of this app to ensure that anyone can find care on their schedule- regardless of their financial condition. Only if a caregiver opts for a professional help will they be charged. A portion of this will be used to continue updating and extending the app.  Recommendations from geriatric experts and small launches partnered with professional societies would be the initial spark to kickstart this platform. Moving forward- word of mouth via local support groups and aid circles among alzheimer’s patients’ families will help keep the customer base growing. Our research demonstrated that this app is about as easy to use as Uber- which is a service that has scaled to millions of users around the world.  The key objective is to protect free-time for the family caregivers inproblematic moments- regardless of their pocket size. To discover the impact of our services- we will ask family caregivers to answer questions (tension index) in the beginning to monitor tension and stress levels. We can periodically monitor and track responses to these surveys and compare it to the initial benchmark to measure effectiveness of the platform as a means to improve their experience.  The next step is getting our wireframe coded in swift. After that- we will build awareness by partnering with local dementia/alzheimer's foundations along with the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab research hospital. We found that many primary caregivers are highly involved with walks- fundraisers and political lobbying events- which are ideal opportunities to present our product directly to our users- we will be focusing on marketing at these events. ,0,1
 Using the Q&As on the Caregiver Forum on AgingCare.com I will codify these Q&Asinto a handbook or bible for dementia caregivers.  This idea is for family caregivers. The idea is to create an online authoritative source for frequently asked questions about the behavioral- financial and legal- relational aspects of dementia caregiving- among others. Think of it as a manual or online database on dementia caregiving with the content provided expert and the community of caregivers who have participated in the Caregivers Forum on AgingCare.com.  As a manager of a Meetup for Memory Loss Caregivers in Washington- DC- I could develop a prototype Q&A format for review by the Meetup participants.  -Brainstorming about the format. -information about experts in dementia care. -Brainstorming about distribution channels. -Information about funding sources and links to the sources.

 The calendar encourages our loved ones stay active in a structured day- and stay connected with family members.  This idea is designed for people with dementia who lives in a facility. Besides it provides loved ones with dementia a structured day instead of being bored and staying in bed the whole day- it helps family members to reach their loved ones through leaving a voice message- and check if they are doing ok. It also gives loved ones support that people care about them.  0-3 months  An Individual  I am a senior Industrial Designs student at California College of the Arts.

 It's a kitbox with unusual activities in wich the caregivers get amezed each day.  Our idea desing is based on the opportunity to help the caregivers reducing their weak moments with the execution of different activities each day. Each 15 days this activities would be update for them(per month 2 boxes).  We have been talking with different caregivers about what they missed and what they would want to do during their work because sometimes they have really weak and hard moments to confront with the person in charge.  We are three Industrial design students from de Xaverian University- Colombia. The kitbox is our final project of this term. The concept that we are using is based on having high impact- low technology- high level of interaction and low complexity.  0-3 months  A student collaboration ,0,0
 Working to keep elderly people connected with their friends- family- carers and loved ones.  Our product is designed for an entire family network to use with the key beneficiaries being the primary caregivers and elderly user. It is a way to enable passive communication using existing daily routines- or habituated appliances such as a kettle. Because it uses existing routines it can also be a reliable way of passively monitoring if an elderly user has been active.  We have been working on ourfunctional prototype and have established connections with two large aged care providers to help test our prototypes and find out how effective they are.We are working closely with these two aged care providers in South East Queensland as well as a research team at the Queensland University of Technology to run user testing and feedback sessions with elderly users to sculpt the product into something that will be easily adopted.  We see OpenIDEO as a great platform to bring to light many of the issues faced by this community- and in doing so- provide a network of like minded people to help create solutions- enable aging in place- and break down the stigma of aging.The greater community will see long term benefits as well- with a load taken off healthcare systems and aged care providers as the solutions created off the back of this program begin to alleviate people's dependence- and provides them with autonomy  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  Our ever expanding team has an array of experience from health and fitness- software engineering- user experience- business and design. We all share a passion for innovation and problem solving. We work closely with professionals from the aged care sector find their sore points and create solutions.  Loneliness is amongst the elderly community- has been outlined in multiple research papers as a growing health concern- with one in three people over the age of 65 being considered isolated and alone. Isolation can be a major driver that increases the effects of dementia.We are working on a digital solution to keep them connected with their families and loved ones  Conpago has redesigned the Companion in order to achieve greater accessibility for caregivers. The Conpago Companion now fits any existing tablet available on the market. This lowers the cost to caregiver and dementia sufferer. Through the new design- we have been able reduced the cost by 50%- allowing greater affordability to end users.  The Conpago Companion will have corresponding apps downloadable on any iOS or Android device- allowing any number of caregivers or family members to interact with the dementia patient. This device can be effective for caregivers with loved ones at an early stage of dementia- allowing for ageing in place through the device's passive monitoring ability. This same device has already caught the attention of nursing homes aiming to a reduce invasive checkups on their permanent residential patients.  Conpago is focusing heavily on the user feedback from end users- especially caregivers of individuals the early to mid stages of dementia. This is the primary way we plan to measure the impact of our idea- since our goals are aimed towards assisting caregivers. The secondary way of measuring the impact of our idea is the increase of independence given to caregivers by using the Conpago Companion- through the use of task distribution through the Conpago app.  Conpago will continue to refine the Companion in order to give end users the best experience possible. We will look continue to look for funding so that we can push this product to the international market. Conpago aims to alleviate the burdens that caregivers have by implementing any new innovations that appear in the world of tech- whilst ensuring people with dementia maintain a good standard of living by allowing them to have as much independence for as long as possible. ,0,1

 Reducing the burden on caregivers by providing a transportation solution catered to the specific needs of individuals with dementia.  Transportation is essential to leading an independent life and driving is one of the first skills that people with dementia lose. We propose an on-demand transportation service tailored to the needs of people with dementia. This will reduce the burden on caregivers to provide transportation. Additionally- it will extend a sense of independence for people in early stages of the disease.  We would like to conduct a trial run of our service providing transportation for the father of one of the caregivers we interviewed during research. This will allow us to test the different features of the service and how effectively our solution provides value.  We are unsure if our approach should be around designing a whole new service or if we should attempt to provide an add-on or extension to an existing service like Uber or Lyft.A few other things we are interested in getting feedback and discussing: -Legal Issues and Liability concerns -Feasibility -Value of specific features  4 months - 1 year  A student collaboration  Kinjal Shah- Scott Cowell and Tyler Gumb are a team of three graduate students currently studying Interaction Design at SVA.

 We aim to improve the situation in which the patient is isolated and alone to become “alive inside” and reminded of their relationships.  Remind is designed for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers. Patients are connected with their families through a personalized music device and mobile application. The device is used by the patient and managed by their family members or caregivers through the app. When the patient does not remember a face- a sound is used in place to “remind” the user and trigger memories.  We have evidence that proves the concept could work for some and we want to dedicate more time to using music to try to awaken memories with individuals across various stages of Alzheimer's- and together with caregivers and at nursing homes. We also feel the design of both the app and tangible music player needs to be refined for both the caregiver and person living with Alzheimer's respectively- therefore we would continue crafting and testing mockups and prototypes until it's good enough.  We'd appreciate any help that gets us closer to not only bringing this project to life- but improves the system and experience we are proposing. We'd also love to hear about the community's experience providing care with the help of music. Also we're eager to find technologies that can enable the seamless interaction between the people and the music at just the right moment.  Over 1 year  A student collaboration  Two of us are Interaction Designers at different tech companies and two are Industrial Designers working at design consultancies. We all graduated together from Umeå Institute of Design a few years ago. We have diverse professional backgrounds between us- including work in healthcare and wellness.  It is a digital music player and application designed for people with Alzheimer's.Along with the well-known benefits of music- their songs help them remember who they are- but there wasn't a music player on the market that has been designed for their specific needs. So we designed one- along with a platform for caregivers so that they can manage the music library and music therapy.  Throughout our design process we have prioritized solving usability issues that people face- such as loss of dexterity- poor vision- etc. Concerning accessibility in terms of cost- organizations such as Music and Memory are dedicated to the efforts of sourcing and distributing mp3 players- as well as recruiting volunteers. We aim to keep our price below the ones they currently use- to make our Remind system an opportunity for everyone.  Remind is a system that includes both a device and software- but we plan to design a version of the ios and android app that can be used without our music player- but instead using existing personal devices- speakers- and headphones. The concept can not include some of the features but will be scalable as long as there is music. We will educate people on how to use it through the website.  By observing people use it- as well as feedback- stories from caregivers and nursing home workers on their experiences using the music system with their care-recipient. Since this an emotional topic- we want to provide a space for users to share the success and challenges they have in an open forum- to help them help each other strengthen their relationships while spreading awareness of Remind.  During this phase we have gathered more feedback and refined the physical design of the music player. Next steps are to improve the UX/UI of the companion application and web platform- so that we can get it all back in the hands of our users for further testing. ,0,1
 My idea is to implement a training system for family caregivers to learn how to manage the constant change of behaviors in their loved ones.  My idea is designed specifically for the family caregivers so that they become more mentally prepared with the progression of the disease. Many caregivers can handle caring for their loved one aside from the obstacles that interfere. However- as the disease advances to its middle stages where behavior becomes more difficult to handle- caregivers may fall in a state of depression and isolation. Since it is nearly impossible to remove the emotional attachment- caregivers tend to become hopeless.  I can see how many people in my community have a loved one affected by dementia or know others who have and get them to communicate this idea to see if a big percentage of them would be interested in participating in a training process like the one mentioned above.  One skill can be sending out the idea to larger populations to get a better representation of how many individuals will be interested in participating in something like this.  0-3 months  An Individual  Since I am only in the beginning of my college career- I do not have much experience on such subjects. ,0,0

 Communication barriers raise relationship struggles. Our design invites new ways of connecting by fostering moments of better understanding.  Dementia changes significantly how a person experiences the world. Our first instinct in reaction to this might be to try to hold on to how things were before. However- trying to limit or adding constraints to these changes can create more difficulties for all the people affected by the disease. Our design intervention is an invitation to explore how a person with dementia and their family members can connect on different levels- that would allow the emergence of moments of better understanding.  A few weeks ago- our team attended a conference called ‘Opening Up About Alzheimer’s: a conversation with Geri and James Taylor’- who are nationally noted Alzheimer’s activists. Since then we have meet with them privately and invited them to collaborate with us once we had a more formulated project idea. On the other hand- we would like to reconnect with The New School’s Institute for Retired Professionals (IRP)- since we know some of participants are alzheimer non-clinical caregivers who ha  We envision that having a collaboration with the OpenIDEO community and co-designing together through creative sessions- would be a great learning experience to combine methods- spaces and perspectives. Including these insights of collaboration will definitely helps us reshape our project- fostering a safe non judgemental space for patients and caregivers and start to breakdown the stigma around the illness.  0-3 months  A student collaboration  We are 3 students at the MFA Transdisciplinary Design program at Parsons that has a service/system design approach emphasizing on collaborative design-led research within social innovation.

 A data base that answers all the questions for care givers with a template for all components of care and a community connection.  If a loved one needs to care for someone with dementia- all the answers are there already. But they are scattered and care givers are overwhelmed. This system would have you put in all your information (for example- location and assets effect what services you can obtain)- aggregates the data and puts together a road map for everything you qualify for and templates to implement the care. This instantly takes someone one from fear to familiarity.  Offer this as a resource to doctors offices to give to families of those diagnosed with dementia- or a major research hub- like UCLA. They could help us track the data and glitches.  Research into qualifications for state home care assistance outside of California- and tricks needed to qualify for those services.

 BrightGuide is a web app that helps family caregivers prompt their loved ones and show customized instructions for daily living activities.  Our idea is designed for caregivers with a loved one in the early/mid-stages of dementia- whose focus is independence. Adult child caregivers face career and parental responsibilities at the same time- and need tools for vital daily activities. We support family caregivers by teaching families new ways to interact with loved ones/increase quality of life at home. By creating wellness within families- persons with dementia achieve self-determination and families thrive when they are resilient.  We have partnered with a local care facility Trinity Village (www.trinityvillage.com) to pilot our idea with members of their Adult Day Program and Assisted Living facility. This experiment will allow us to give 6 participants tablets for 3 months while we observe their performance with and without BrightGuide. This is a great way to find how much stress the BrightGuide tool relieves from their care partners and how much time or effort is saved- enhancing quality of life for family care partners  We know that bring a digital health solution to market requires the collaboration of many groups: we need help with telecommunications partnerships (providing stable- affordable internet access)- device hardware partnerships (ensuring families have accessible tablets)- creating efficient marketing and distribution channels and providing advocacy and caregiver education for behavioural health. Please see our How You Can Help image to answer our questions to the community.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  I have experience caregiving for my grandfather currently living with Alzheimer's. I have a BSc in Chemistry and a Masters in Business Entrepreneurship & Technology from the University of Waterloo. I have 3+ years experience health informatics innovation with Medella Health and Health Canada.  BrightGuide helps persons living with early-stage dementias relearn their daily routine through videos of themselves. This gives autonomy and peace of mind to their family caregivers. Caregivers use the BrightGuide app on a tablet to film and schedule instructions for vital daily activities. This provides contextually-rich and culturally-appropriate cues for assisting the person- with dignity.  Cognitive: Brain imaging studies show visual cues can be understood until the late stages of dementia. Our own voice/face is more trustworthy to show us “how-to” succeed in daily activities Mobile: Our tablet case & UI design make it easy for elderly users to operate BrightGuide on the device they already own Economic: 80 families said they can pay $100 CAD per month- saving them thousands of dollars in homecare costs Global: Technique works in every culture & language- only needs WiFi  We are seeking partners like AARP- AT&T- Google- Amazon- etc. to integrate BrightGuide into private homes. We can distributeour React Native app globally through popular app stores after usability tests in March 2018. To support global users- our legal council at Gowling WLG have developed Terms of Service suited for users' local laws. We will work with local chapters of Alzheimer's associations to support and train caregivers on best practices for using BrightGuide.  We plan to measure the impact of our idea inside the app through weekly self-reported “check-ins” and metrics related to videos watched and skipped (didn't need the video/didn't do the activity). Weekly surveys: Caregivers are asked about their stress- sense of control and frequency of repetition to measure their emotional stress- role empowerment- time saved. Their loved ones are asked about their confidence in performing daily activities and self-esteem to measure their autonomy and dignity.  Our immediate next steps are:- gathering user testimonies and evidence through existing partners like Trinity Village (January 2018) - developing a refined native version of the app (March 2018) - deploying in the app stores with a payment option (April 2018) - nurturing partnerships through IDEO to understand local challenges worldwide (early 2018) - developing a go-to-market strategy that addresses national and global challenges (late 2018) ,0,1
 Improve the relationships between both caregivers and people with dementia with an interactive analogue response (booklet and toy).  We created this idea with a main purpose- to generate strong bonds and relieve between caregivers and people with dementia in situations that involve stress and pain- like the ones produced in psychotic attacks.The booklet and the toy will be a tool to reduce the stress and overcome the attacks- serving as an instruction book for the caregiver and a relieve to the person suffering the attack.  The booklet and the toy will be tested in numerous exams in different institutions- that would give us the necessary information to improve the project and receive appropriate feedback from the caregivers and the patients.  The guidance of developing proper projects with the right feedback will improve the effect of our idea. Also- the possibility of making this idea known worldwide will be helpful.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm A student collaboration ,0,0
 An easy card game to help the care-giver and care-recipient express what is important to them- designed to strengthen the bond between them.  The idea is designed for both- family caregivers and their loved ones at the early stages of being diagnosed withdementia- to support a meaningful conversation about what really matters - to them- as individuals and together.  We will be testing our idea with the family caregivers and mental health nurses we interviewed during our research phase. We will also be testing the idea with a professor who has over 25 years experience in dementia care and is internationally recognised for his authority on dementia care practice and policy.Secondly- we would like to test the idea with care homes in Spain- New Zealand and Australia (to test the idea cross-culturally) and local community groups working with elderly people.  Once we have a prototype- we would like to test the cards with as many people as possible to ensure we have accounted for all the possible things which may be important to care-givers and care-recipients. Testing with the OpenIDEO community will also help us ensure the cards are as inclusive as possible of other cultures.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  We are a team of three- passionate about driving change in healthcare. We work at Bupa-a global healthcare company which funds healthcare around the world and runs clinics- dental centres- hospitals- care homes and retirement villages in a number of countries.  It’s a really simple card game for someone who is going to be the primary care giver for a loved one who has recently been diagnosed with dementia- to talk about what matters to each of them in order to start preparing for their journey ahead together.  The statements chosen for our cards are the result of our conversations with relatives and care givers and relevant to both the care-giver and care-recipient. A card game as it is an inexpensive way of promoting vital conversations- as well as being a familiar activity (playing cards) to most people. We are exploring the possibility of an online version as well as testing across different countries. Our early conversations give us confidence that the game can be translated and localised.  Our idea is simple – two decks of cards with instructions which can be distributed from front line services- such as the NHS Memory Service and Admiral Nurses in the UK. To maximise our reach we will partner with charity organisations (e.g. Alzheimer Society UK) to spread awareness. As models of dementia care develop from residential to home care- we believe we have a role to play- eg. services which train informal care givers to care for their loved ones in their own home- would benefit from it  We would aim to pilot the tool and hold focus groups with participants to receive feedback. We would like to measure “sense of confidence” about the future before and after using the cards. We would also like to know what actions have come from having the conversations promoted by the cards- as well as whether people would recommend the game to others.  We are aiming to approach the services which we have identified are key to reaching the people who will benefit most from our game. We want to bring them on board whilst we develop the tool- so that we can ensure it is accessible and works with the systems in place. ,0,1
 Improve the quality of life of both caregiver and participant with classic- relatable artwork during planned activity time.

 This forum provides awareness and knowledge of better strategies of care for a loved one while fostering connections with other caregivers.  This series is designed for family and friends who are caring for a person living with dementia.The main focus of the series is education and information dissemination regarding dementia and dementia care.Additionally- an important component is the community of support that the series provides to the participant through meeting once a week over the course of a five-week period with a small- consistent group of people- all of whom are caring for a loved one living with dementia.  The Series was piloted in 2016- and five online groups have been conducted since.Moving forward- we plan to make the series available in a community setting with the intentions of reaching a greater number of people and increasing the potential for caregiver support.This strategy can be piloted with a community organization with whom PAC has already established a working relationship.We can refine the logistics in this setting prior to offering it in new communities.  We are interested in expanding accessibility to our target audience by forming new connections with community groups or care facilities where a group of people could access the webinar together from a central location.Doing so would give access to those who may not have available the necessary equipment. This would also increase the potential for formation of community support networks.OpenIDEO's global connections- network- and know-how would be a wonderful resource and partnership in this.

 We support people with dementia in performing everyday activities which gives them a feeling of being less dependent  People with dementia- mainly in stage 2/3 CDR. As it supports independency of the caretaker- it reduces the amount of care given by the caregiver.  We have tested the concept with two second stage dementia caretakers with a first prototype (application on a phone)- and analysed why the device might or might not work in context. Secondly- we have the opportunity to make use of the GGZE network- in order to reach caretakers and caregivers.  We are three Industrial design students at the Technical University of Eindhoven- The Netherlands. Guidementia was our first Master project. The concept won two design challenges and received a lot of positive feedback from both caregivers as well as caretakers.

 The importance of information as an accompanying resource for the elderly with dementia on the part of the caregiver  Elaboration of a portal with several resources (videos- interviews- forum- research) and gamification so that the caregiver besides having information about the disease can participate in a support group and have quality of life  The goal is to integrate information- community of caregivers (through the forum) and specialists. Once health professionals guide caregivers to access the portal- and caregivers realize the importance of this communication environment- access will increase  In order to implement this proposal- it will be necessary to contact experts dealing with dementia (physicians- physiotherapists- psychologists and nutritionists). In addition- it will be necessary professionals who have knowledge of digital accessibility to elaborate the portal and implementation resources. I will need the help of OpenIDEO to develop this project.  0-3 months  An Individual  I am biomedical and act as a distance tutor in Virtual Learning Environments (AVA).

 I thought of this idea as a result of caring for loved ones with dementia and helping other caregivers.  The Help U Care Assistant would educate the caregiver about how to deal with behaviors that accompany Alzheimer's disease- such as- resistance- agitation- wandering- resulting in a great reduction of caregiver stress and allowing the care recipient to remain at home- thereby- cutting long-term care costs. The Assistant would be built on top of a device such as the Google Home or Amazon Alexa already existing in millions of homes- making it accessible to many.  I would host focus groups with caregivers caring for a loved one with dementia to get input on whether they would like to use such a device and rate on a scale basis how they feel about having such a device.  To learn the best methods to incorporate merging the Help U Care Assistant with existing devices.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  I am a public health educator.

 An au pair service matching millennial live-in caregivers and people with dementia  This idea provides live-in support for those with dementia- giving loved ones an affordable way to get assistance in caring for their loved ones- while providing millennials with a way to save on rent and give back.  A very early service prototype could be posting an ad for live-in caregivers to the targeted millennial demographic and an ad for families who have loved one(s) with dementia. This can be done in the form of a Craigslist ad or job boards (for the live-in caregiver) and in the form of posts or conversations on communities (for the families of those with dementia).  It would be great to get feedback and opinions from the OpenIDEO community!  0-3 months  A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter  The team behind this idea included: - A caregiver - A service designer - A graphic designer - An IDEO community manager - An operations professional at a major hospital - A medical technology designer ,0,0
 Make a digital summary with the medicines- exams- illnes- etcthat can make us figure it out if our relative has or can has senile dementia  This app is develop thinking on the relatives that have to take care to elderly relatives. It is designed to help to know about the signs- the clues and the symptoms that can help them to have the  right diagnosis earlier than espected. They can have a resume of all he exams- medicines- doctors- etc; that can help with the diagnosis- all in the cloud- and help any doctor to see all of them.

I always talk and ask people about this with a resume about my project- and they give me feedback about things that in some cases I ever think. Some people also told me different cases in their families- but all of them have the same question: What they can do; which are the signs if someone has senile dementia. That's the reason why I want this project to be real. My project can help them to find a tool to bear it.  I thing that the first is just to make this challegence. In my project I feel that I am almost the only one who cares and believe that we can make changes using tecnologies to improves health and lives to elder people.

 VRx- a library of customized immersive experiences- ameliorates behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia and reduces caregiver burden.  Our goal is to reduce the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia that contribute to caregiver burnout and often result in the institutionalization of a loved one. We have created a library of VR “experiences” (e.g. calm lake- tranquil garden) that aim to stimulate psychological/cognitive health by decreasing depression- anxiety- and aggression and reducing wandering. This approach is less costly and more dignified than many current practices (e.g. neuroleptic drugs/restraints).  We completed an initial feasibility study (n=56- three sites) validating the use of VR among people with dementia when administered by researchers in a controlled environment. Given the positive findings- we improved the VR-therapy and are ready to evaluate it with larger target patient population- engaging caregivers through joint participation in the study. We intend to evaluate the process of administering the VR therapy by formal/ informal caregivers- and people with dementia themselves.  Connecting us with organizations advocating for individuals with dementia and their caregivers would be very helpful as we could receive feedback about the VR experiences we create and discuss potential barriers to implementation from unique stakeholder perspectives. Of course- bringing widespread awareness of our initiative using OpenIDEO’s various powerful social media platforms will be very helpful in extending the project scope and seeking industry partnerships that could ensure its success.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  OpenLab is an innovation shop that provides expertise in the field of user-centered design- with a track record of successful co-design initiatives that transform the way health care is delivered and experienced.

 An online gallery of paintings- photos- drawings- cartoons- poetry- video- & stories by and for caregivers who support people with dementia  We think of caregivers as stressed and depressed. This project flips that script- elevating caregiving to an experience that naturally generates and benefits from creative expression.This online portal provides a peaceful- inspiring- validating place caregivers can go to any time of day or night to see their experience reflected in others' artwork -- and upload their own creations- however amateur. The message: Caregivers are artists- each with their own stories to tell.  Perhaps we would start with writing classes and art classes for adults. These classes attract older people- many of whom would likely have caregiving experience.If we could find a way to give these people an assignment -- e.g.- express your caregiving experience via the artistic medium you're already exploring -- we could begin to assess proof of concept. Asking a random busy caregiver to express herself artistically might be tougher- but photography could be an easy entry point.  What organizations are already encouraging artwork by caregivers? How is that going? The National Center for Creative Aging has a Creative Caregiving initiative. Caregiver.com hosts an annual Caregiving Art Show. Who else is doing something similar or complementary? How would we find artists and writers to give mini-lessons? Would the site need to be private- for registered users only- to encourage amateur submissions?Should we allow people to connect with others by commenting on their work?  0-3 months  A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter An Individual  I serve as the VP for Innovation and Planning at ASAE: The American Society of Association Executives.

 Listening to my Heartbeat Lullabies can dramatically reduce demented behavior and dramatically improve cognitive abilities.  Individuals having the diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer’s- including those family members or caregivers- have the potential to improve dementia behavior and cognitive abilities with the implementation of playing Heartbeat Lullabies.  I have already done that in local assisted living facilities.  Try playing it in a home setting or memory care unit. If your facility has a Music and Memory program this is perfect way to introduce it via iPhones and head sets for quick results. I will send you the download free upon request.

 A smart platform caregivers can use to transform spaces through light and color- & explore the senses in the most delightful way.  Healing Spaces is designed for both professional and family caregivers- and those with mid to advanced dementia. This project focuses on the design of playful sensory experiences that have the potential to address the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. It is also a toolset for caregivers to better manage and conduct sensory-based activities.  With a robust prototype in the works for Spring 2018- my goal is to maintain regular visits to one of the communities we're working with- sharing weekly prototypes and gathering feedback.We also plan to conduct playtest sessions and workshops with caregivers- in collaboration with the USC Family Caregiver Support Center- making sure we also have the perspective from those caring for loved ones at home.  As we prepare for our first pilot next semester to collect feasibility data and build an initial case study- our project could benefit from guidance in how we could start consolidating the idea for a larger scale deployment- moving from a MFA thesis to an actual product- or experience package- as we like to call it. If there are any writers- artists- sound designers- iOS developers and engineers in the community who are interested in the project- we would love to hear from you!  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  I am an experience designer & visual artist- currently pursuing a MFA in Interactive Media & Game Design at the School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles- California. Experience with interaction design- visual design and film. More: www.aboutgabi.com  A smart platform that allows caregivers to transform spaces through light- color- sounds and visuals- turning any space into a place where people with dementia can focus and relax. Inspired by the research legacy of traditional Multisensory Environments (MSEs)- our app works together with Philips Hue smart lights- and is designed to extend the virtual experience into the physical space.  We use commercially available off-the-shelf components and take into consideration the reusability of each component in other aspects of care. We chose to design this smart platform as an app for the iPad because it gives caregivers and our end users instant portable access to not only our experiences- but also to a whole ecosystem of applications and resources. We also adopted a modular design approach. Healing Spaces is made to work with both low-end and high-end setups (see Setup infographic)  In its post-thesis life- Healing Spaces would be available for download in the App Store- and would also have a robust online presence- a centralized place where caregivers can find extensive documentation- resources and updates- learn more about sensory-based activities and engage with the community. I would love this home page to encourage users to build upon our tools- and share their own experiences with our product- allowing us to keep creating content that is fresh and meaningful.  We’ll be conducting a feasibility study in a memory care community in late February. Our goal is to examine if Healing Spaces helps reduce agitation in persons with dementia- if it is engaging for both users- and if it makes sensory-based activities easier & more enjoyable. We'll be using two assessment tools to measure agitation and engagement- as well as direct observation notes- surveys and interviews with caregivers. Results will be shared in the form of a case study.  - Finalize pilot study design- measurable outcomes and IRB application. - Incorporate Alpha prototype feedback to new iteration and content creation. - Refine and polish prototype for the pilot study- focusing on simplicity -core features and meaningful content. - Maintain weekly visits to the community- showing staff a new iteration of the prototype each week. ,1,1
 Board game for people living with dementia  Originally designed for use in Care Homes- but used extensively by families and carers at home and in many different settings. It opens up conversations- gets connections made- makes the person with dementia feel loved- cared for and special. You will never run out of things to talk about whilst learning about each other and creating stronger bonds. Enjoyed by all the family from about five years old. Great for creating fun and laughter as people relax and memories are recalled.  I'd like to try it out with different languages and communities.  I've had many requests for different language versions- so I need help with this.

 Online tool for assessment- planning and decision making - developed for the unpaid family caregiver.  Adult children with paid employment caring for parent or in-law; newer to caregiving or just starting to have questions. Agefully develops skills important to any caregiver- while addressing concerns specific or especially relevant to those helping people with dementia- including driving- financial exploitation- communication strategies and decision-making. Agefully also helps users understand the caregiver role and how it may change- to encourage self-care and use of supports.  Private grant funding has supported us to build a prototype app and we are currently concluding a pilot test with 50 individual caregivers- with plans for a 2nd pilot in Spring of 2018.We would be excited to expand the testing/feedback of the application with commercial or strategic partners- ideally in conjunction with evaluating potential business models.  Primarily- our team needs help in: 1) Efficient marketing / raising awareness for the tool so people can find it; 2) Developing a revenue model that will support the application (hosting- technical support- content review / updating); and 3) Exploring partnerships or organizational structures to maintain the app in the future.Additionally- if the tool can be leveraged to provide additional features or value to the community- we would love to consider those ideas in future versions.

 The Kit offers information and reflective tools for persons with dementia and their carers to manage living with dementia positively.  The Good Life Kit offers post-diagnosis support for persons with early-mid stage dementia and their loved ones/carers to deal with feelings of uncertainty and insecurity after the diagnosis- and to prepare for and manage changes and challenges positively. Through a mindful and positive psychology approach- the kit will support and empower persons with dementia- and thus reduce strain on carers. It willincrease empathy and mutual understanding to strengthen the relationship between both.  The design idea is being developed as part of the MinD project: Designing for People with Dementia- www.designingfordementia.eu Research has been conducted over the past year to identify the need for the idea. Throughout the design development- co-design sessions with people with dementia- carers and healthcare professionals are being consulted to provide input to ensure relevance and appropriateness of the design.

 Enabling people with dementia to stay independent longer by helping them get dressed.  Dressing is a very private experience and you want to keep doing it yourself as long as you can. In order to make dressing easier for people with dementia- we designed a drawer system to help getting dressed by filling it once a week with chosen outfits and pointing out the order in which the clothes need to be put on.This way the care-recipient can stay independent for longer and the caregiver has more time for social activities.  We are currently preparing a user test for people with dementia. We are going to test if the guidance will work as expected.

 YouthCare is a respite and memory care program that partners trained student volunteers and persons with early-stage dementia one on one.  YouthCare is designed as a win-win-win situation for caregivers- students- and seniors with Alzheimer’s. Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging. Seniors: helps battle social isolation and creates a setting for purposeful aging via the mentor-mentee rapport that develops between seniors and caregivers.  We are already currently running a similar- but grant-funded program- TimeOut@UCLA.In 2 years- TimeOut@UCLA has paired over 100 students and seniors- offering 3000+ hours of care. The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite.  We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.  4 months - 1 year  A student collaboration  In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.  YouthCare is the least expensive respite care that creates in an intergenerational bridge to create three very important outcomes. First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.  The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.  Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.  For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors). Our quantity and scale will be measured by the number of low-cost respite care hours we are able to provide.  Get our program off the ground at USC! ,1,1
 We strive to bring joy- comfort- and connections to those affected by dementia- by using photo reminiscence of one's favorite things.  While our products are designed for both the professional and personal caregiver- and can be used in a facility or at home- with a group or an individual- we find the one on one experience to be the most person centered.By individualizing the experience to the cared person- participants can find joy and be comforted by connecting through conversation- happiness and a reprieve from isolation- sadness and depressive thoughts.  Favorite things reminiscence products were developed using feedback we received from professional caregivers working within facilities- and individual caregivers for their loved ones in their homes.We have made many changes and enhancements based on feedback- some of which were- adding music to our videos- size and durability of cards- and subject matter.We continue to work with caregivers- do onsite visits with caregivers and those they care for as their feedback is key.  The community could assist in ideas for marketing- SEO- and insight into future collections.As a veteran owned business- we would like help reaching out to veteran organizations.We are using US based companies for production and insight into production would be helpful.Our greatest need is to reach the seniors/caregivers and marketing directly to them.

 Empathy- as a tool- results in fewer disruptive behaviors and gives caregivers asense of control and reduces burnout for them.  This program is designed for family caregivers for persons with Vascular Dementia- Alzheimer'sand Lewy Body. This idea supports appropriate expressions of empathy by rates of dementia in major ethnic groups and healthcare providers. Culturally appropriate expressions of empathy prevent disruptive behaviors and reduce isolation in care recipients. Use of empathy as a caregiving tool provides caregivers with a greater sense of control and reduces burnout in them.  Find several family caregivers for an informal discussion about empathy and current ways they used. Obtain family caregivers' perceptions about empathy as a caregiving tool. For example- Sibley Senior Association has memory care groups in lower income DC neighborhoods and could recruit family members for this experiment.  - Identify available empathy assessment tools. Assess their appropriateness for use with family caregivers. - Provide guidance for developing empathy assessment tools. - Provide guidance for testing assessment tools with family members. - Identify effective ways to identify differences in the cultural expression of empathy by major ethnic groups. - Provide guidance on setting up Empathy Training Bootcamps. - Brainstorm on deployment techniques.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm An Individual  Our group included the following: - A business owner that provides respite care for persons with Dementia.- Writer/interviewer from Memory Well - Participants who have family members with Dementia - AARP staff person who had observed a variety of family caregivers and their loved ones. ,0,0
 A mobile App that is used by care givers to monitor the health state of their loved ones and reach out for help from others when needed  The idea is designed for someone whose loved ones got dementia (at the early stage) and they are usually too busy with lives to deliver full time care giving to their loved ones. This app would help them to monitor their loved ones’ health state in real time and when there would be any emergency happening- they can easily check and reach out someone in the community nearby their loved ones to do a favor for them.  This is a conceptual Idea which haven’t been tested in the community nearby yet. But the Core idea is to share human Resources by location proximity and to help out others who are in need as much as we can since we share the similar empathy.  I think it would be good that the openIDEO community would provide some guidance in terms of design thinking process and technology vision. And also- it would be good if relevant parties which can deliver more inside and professional suggestions to the specific topic can give some real time feedback for design ideas if someone consults (like realtime idea exchange).  0-3 months  A student collaboration  We are two design students who have background of Master study of industry design. ,0,0

I'm currently managing a team of five caregivers- along with four siblings who pitch in to help as necessary. I would be happy to design the template for a comprehensive app that would impact all areas of caregiving and resources for people with dementia.  I think this idea is self-explanatory; it would require an app developer working with someone like myself to ensure optimal user-friendly design- appropriate content- adaptability to each user- and the opportunity to grow and evolve with continuous use.

 Building up a new incorruptible caregiver-loved one relationship while dementia progresses- by making tangible props of fictional realities.  While the ability to recall events of the past collapse around the affected person- therapeutic efforts mainly focus on “scaffolding” and “maintain” existing memories. This leaves caregivers with the solitary responsibility of remembering and preserving the “correct” truth of what it was. Souvenir aims to provide a generative space where caregivers and their beloved ones would recall shared memories to create together new stories and tangible artifacts of them- irrespective of their truthfulness  We might try a small scale Souvenir service with people in our network: Simone- psychiatrist- as the therapist- Laura as the 3d designer and 3 couples of caregiver +loved one.

 An experience room that leverages reminiscence to open updementia patients by changing its content to display the familiar.  This is designed to open up late stage dementia patients- helping them to get the much needed contact between patient and caregiver. As dementia patients regress into final stages they often close up to the outside world. Caregivers find it harder and harder to reach and recognise their loved ones. They find it hard to talk to them and miss the emotional connection that once was there.  We have build a virtual window- radio and picture frames and are planning to place this in a living lab located at a Dutch care institute. This is done in collaboration with Eindhoven University off Technology. With the consent of the family we will wizard of oz the installation to test if the multimedia surroundings add value to the experience and has the desired effect.

 Help dementia patients remember important details about their family with just a touch.  Caregivers- patients and their family members are both important parts of this idea. FamilyTies will support caregivers by making it easier for them to help a patient understand the importance of the family member in front of them and keeping connected with the family members they love.  To test how FamilyTies could help patients- my grandfather will be the first patient. Recently he received the diagnoses of dementia and though most often stable sometimes reacts like he has confused me with my father wondering what I am doing at their house despite me being a common visitor. After a small bit of explaining I will see how both my grandmother and grandfather react when using it and test for the next week or so how it has affected their relationship and his recognition of me.  I would like the OpenIDEO community to input their opinions on how they think the app should look like as well as information on how they would feel using this all as either a patient or caregiver.As well- what do you think about combining with use of a worn device like Concept N. Finally what social information do they think would be most important for the app to display and should it be only inputted by the specific family members themselves or could it be info gained by other members as well.  0-3 months  An Individual  I am college student with a major in biology however one of my favorite hobbies is regularly attending and often winning Hackathons(programming events designed around creating a new idea using a specific theme or product)and Developer Conferences-both big and small- such as the 2017 one by Box ,0,0
 A way for the caregiver/s to align people in their micro environment for gaining support and having normal social interactions.  The Compassion Box focusses on the 'social wellbeing' of the caregivers. It's a toolkit which the caregivers may use to generate awareness & sensitise family- friends- neighbours & other people (shopkeeper vendors- bankers- maids etc.) -who are part of the daily interaction circle of the caregiver & patient's family.It is full of bite-sized yet nuanced information about Dementia in the form of artifacts like accordion leaflets- origami toys- bookmarks- tote bag- flash cards- calendar etc.  For early experiment- I'd like to talk to caregivers and create a broad overview of the kind of support they need from the community- and the daily struggles they face. Interact with the medical fraternity to find out the most important stuff to include. Do a trial run with 10-15 people around the caregiver- to understand their emotional response to content- to more accurately predict how those emotions translate into action.  Connect to the community of caregivers- doctors- and foundations to create opportunities for interviews- real world testing and feedback. Receive guidance from the OpenIDEO community on concept validation- design/type ofartefacts- packaging of the compassion box and the messaging content.

 A Virtual Reality Social Network for Caregivers.  The idea is designed for caregivers- who have access to the internet- and it helps them using a virtual reality gear to immerse in a virtual community of other caregivers- distant family members as well as volunteers who wish to provide emotional support to them but are unable to be physical near them.  The establishment of a small virtual group of caregivers and some of their distant family members- friends and volunteers dedicated to their emotional support- equipped with virtual reality headsets and cameras- that are going to participate invirtual group therapy sessions.  The programming- development and testing of virtual reality applications is going to be invaluable of course- but also of great value will be the organizational skills and the leadership of online communities.  0-3 months  An Individual  I have worked in the past as an assistant in a microwaves and optical fiber lab- as a system administrator in the First Greek Supercomputing Center (AHPCL)- as a computer programmer in the Greek Army and as a Professor of Microwaves and Antennas in the Greek College for Technology Educators. ,0,0
 A system that addresses the unique challenge of fall prevention for people with dementia.  This system is designed for older adults that suffer from dementia-resultant falls. It allows the caregiver to look after the care-recipient remotely and track him as he navigates through the house and keep in touch with him. It gives them a peace of mind as they guarantee that risks of falling are eliminated.  It is highly recommended to be experimented in my grandparents home or the assisted facility in our neighborhood.

 Herd is a tool offering caregivers 24-7 access to a crowd-sourced network of caregivers for support and advice.  Herd is a tool specifically designed for family caregivers. While caregiving resources are plentiful- it was discovered that online support resources for caregivers were- at times- difficult to find or navigate. Response times to questions ranged and questions sometimes received only a few responses- which varied in terms of relevancy or helpfulness. The goal is to alleviate caregiver stress by reducing wait times while increasing relevancy & helpfulness of responses to caregiver questions.  Initial surveys were distributed to participants to gain a deeper understanding of perspectives- behaviors- and experiences with regard to dementia-related caregiving- as well as visits to local support groups and interviewing participants from the targeted user group about their caregiving experiences and challenges. Since then- high-fidelity prototypes have been designed and we'd like to continue more rounds of user testing with caregivers in the community to enhance the user experience.  Feedback about these major goals would be super helpful: 1) ways to improve Herd's ability to give caregivers an easy way to ask specific questions and receive fast- reliable responses. 2) ways to streamline how caregivers can share their personal expertise and first-hand knowledge to less experienced caregivers- while receiving gratitude and recognition within their peer community.  0-3 months  An Individual  UX/UI designer with a 13+ year background in creative writing and teaching in higher education.

 Caregivers get peace of mind when sensor analytics provide oversight and understanding of a care recipient at home alone.  EmPowerYu is a Care Management tool ideal for optimizing care delivery to persons who cannot accurately report what is happening at home from day to day. EmPowerYu reassures caregivers when home patterns are normal- alerts them to problems- and measures the effect of treatments better than surveys- phone calls- or occasional visits. Knowing what is happening in the home- and having a system that will call out for help- reduces the stress and worry of a working or long-distance caregiver.  We have systems in homes already.One test home is a full time caregiver of his aunt with advanced dementia.He likes to see what is happening at night when he is asleep- so that he can interpret his aunt’s daytime activities with the information about whether she slept well the night before.He also wants to use EmPowerYu’s front door sensor as an alarm so that if she leaves the house at night we can call his cell phone and wake him up to go get her. We will experiment with this soon.  We can hypothesize many possible advantages to specific data collection- as given above. However- collaboration with the OpenIDEO community to brainstorm ideas for what data could help caregivers- refine the ideas- then prioritize the ideas with real caregivers- would be terrific.We want to work with caregivers to validate the usefulness of these ideas- and connect an alert with next steps like a televideo conference with a behavioral expert- music therapy- or talk with an avatar.

 GreyMatters is an interactive life storybook app for the tablet that improves quality of life for people with dementia and their caregivers.  GreyMatters was designed to improve daily life for both family caregivers and their loved ones with dementia. GreyMatters helps to relieve caregiver stress by keeping loved ones with dementia engaged in a meaningful way- which in turn reduces negative behaviors and improves mood. The app's reminiscence activities also give family members of all ages the tools to connect & communicate with a loved one more easily- when it might otherwise feel too difficult to try.  I have already been pilot testing the app at various nursing homes and care communities- where I have received positive feedback from staff members as well as family members of residents. I have also been testing the app with individual family caregivers who are caring for a loved one with dementia. I hope to continue pilot testing the app and gathering research data that demonstrates GreyMatters' positive effects on quality of life for both patients and caregivers.

 Create social inclusion- promote identity and creativity- and counter the stigmatization of elderhood and dementia.  Tear (portuguese for loom)- is designed to help elders and people with dementia stay active- stimulated- motivated- included and creative. Weaving is something most elders know and like- so taking advantage of that- a loom was created that compensates for many impairments associated with old age and dementia- both physically and mentally. It allows elders to prove to others- but most important- to themselves- that they are still able.  Although the idea has been tried and tested- each person has a unique story and experience- and very particular level of ability. More so for people with dementia- where every case is a unique case.In this sense- improvements and adaptations can allways be made. At this stage- a really interesting next step for the project would be to explore more ways to stimulate creativity through the loom- as well as ways to involve more people around it.  Experience with elders and people with dementia will always be a great input for the project. Since every case is different- sharing experiences people have had can potentially bring both new problems and solutions to the table- that might help the product improve. Also- different backgrounds and cultures may provide new ideas for similar approaches using different products or activities.

 Follows 5 fictional dementia care stories starting at various stages in different forms of the disease (e.g. Alzheimer's- vascular- etc.)  The series targets existing and future caregivers- family- friends and the community in general (i.e. everyone). It increases awareness of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias- and helps reduce the stigma by showing the realities of dementia WITHOUT fear mongering. Episodes tackle real caregiving issues- explore solutions and give tips- guidance and ideas.  A pilot- just as in any TV series.

 A care package delivered every month with various items that align with the caregiver's progressive journey.  This is designed for new caregivers and the friends/family that support them to navigate their new normal - a life with caregiving. It's a care package delivered once a month with items that align to the caregiver's needs during different stages of the journey. There are 4 categories of items in every box: Practical- Identity- Community- and Hilarious. These packages can be purchased as a subscription by the caregiver themselves- or as a gift from friends who want to help but don't know how.  We will speak to various caregivers at different stages of the journey to create a comprehensive list of all the types of items/support that they'd like. We will arrange these items in alignment with a general caregiver journey. We will then prototype the items in the first three boxes in the subscription service to see if they are useful.  We'd love feedback all the different items you'd believe are useful forms of support during a caregiver's journey. Practical tools such as information- resources- etc. Identity tools to help with self-discovery and therapy. Community tools to build a sense of belonging and connection. Hilarious tools to bring light-heartedness and fun to each day.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter  We're a team that all met during an OpenIDEO workshop in Washington DC.

 A set of toys and storytelling material that will help the caregiver care for their family including their loved one with dementia.  The toys will be designed for both dementia patients and children and benefit caregivers by engaging and entertaining players in activities and games.The toolkit will give caregivers important information for them to facilitate the activities- but also train themselves in supporting patients with dementia.  We can build games and activities with existing toys (that we already own) and print out a small toolkit which we can test with friends and/or family that care for both dementia patients and their kids. Through this process we can receive their feedback and ask if they would benefit from more material and new activities that could be offered through an app.  Helping us test our idea- by using your experience of games and play for human centered-design -- suggesting how to best engage families with dementia patients.Strengthening the storytelling approach to the kit in order to keep it relevant and feasible for the caregiver to execute it.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  Ximena - A Service Designer and Industrial Designer from Guatemala- currently working in Learning & Development.Rocio- I have worked in innovation and entrepreneurship and teach on social entrepreneurship at a university level. ,0,0
 A device that connects to the TV and allows the caregiver to simplify TV choices and program reminders.  Home Screen empowers caregivers to by solving a common problem: how to work the TV. It simplifies the process- and gives them the ability to program events (like re-occurring TV shows) so that they can have a break in the day and know that their loved one is comfortable and entertained. It also provides a way to passively and consistently remind persons with dementia of important upcoming events- or even more simple details like their location or the weather.  We could mock up the interface for the smart phone and TV- especially to test the optimal number of channels Home Screen might need.

 A person-centred pillow that allows family members to get in touch with their loved one with dementia through personal music and sound.  The idea is designed for people living with dementia in the mid to late stage of the disease. People with dementia tend to turn to their own reality- and this might come across as being lost. Often conversation is no longer sufficient to connect with someone with dementia. The musical pillow allows to facilitate a connection by introducing familiar and personal music and sounds to the conversation. People are often triggered by these personal sounds and they might 'live-up' again by it.  We have put the pillow in context- as you can see in the video.. and it shows great potential! Next step would be to make a small series of pillows and let them be tested over a longer period in time at home of a person with dementia or in a nursing home context.  The interaction part is pretty straightforward- however the backend is still open. How are people going to put music on the pillow? Is there an online platform where family members can easily upload their songs? How can family members record their own stories or music? How does it work with music rights in this situation?

 Provide people with dementia and their caregivers a private 24/7/365 opportunity to voice “inner feelings- without fear of judgment-”  This idea is designed for both caregivers and people with dementia who are isolated from the rest of the society. As they go through the challenges of everyday life- they hardly find the same level of compassion and empathy from the rest of the society. In some cases- they even feel isolated in social gatherings. Digital Companion will listen to their emotions- recognize patterns- advise them to seek help.  An early version of the product is currently available on Google assistant. People are able to reach it be saying “Talk to Digital companion”. It has received 5-star ratings and much interest from across the world. Through this release- we are able to get feedback on the public version. Next- we are trying to identify a facility/ group where we can release the dedicated product- so that both the caregiver and resident communities can benefit from additional features and analysis.  We are looking for help in three aspects: 1.Provide usage scenarios to help us build human interactions in the app 2.Collaborate with us to build new actions and interactions which will be relevant to the family caregiver community as well as to institutions 3.Guidance and resources to help us keep this product and free and open source  Over 1 year  A student collaboration  I have had the unique opportunity to get exposed to the healthcare management challenges for the millennium while watching professionals at Emory and Northside perform critical procedures as well as work alongside researchers at GATech memory and aging lab to identify effects of aging on memory. ,0,0

 A mobile app that is a credible source of information on dementia and accommodates varying stages of caregiving.  Accepting that a loved one has dementia and being the main caregiver can be overwhelming and daunting. With this in mind- Aegis has been designed to assume the role of the silent specialist- assistant and companion. The app is 3 fold - a section which provides information- a care recipient portal and a caregiver portal. From information in sections (based on how far the condition has progressed) to features that assist in making appointments- Aegis supports and streamlines caregiving.  Developing an app of this magnitude and ensuring credibility requires collaboration with professionals and experts in the field . To be successful it would be crucial to involve professionals and caregivers at every stage. An opportunity to share the idea with healthcare service providers to gain their perspective would be ideal. More insights on how the app could tie up with hospitals and institutions would be appreciated.  0-3 months  An Individual  I have a background in Graphic Design and am currently exploring Service Design.

 A velcro clothing line specifically designed to serve the needs of dementia patients and caregivers by facilitating dressing and grooming.  This idea is designed specifically for dementia patients by incorporating pads- convertible wear and comfort. It benefits caregivers by facilitating the process of changing patients by using Velcro in every item.  We will buy basic plain tshirts and adjust them by attaching them with pieces of velcro. We will then distirbute these t-shirts to different care givers and ask them to test them out with their patients. They will then share their feedback with us so that we can pivot our product as needed.  We would benefit greatly from help in our light-weight experiments. Your experience in observation and insight collection can help us pivot our idea and structure it to the needs of our market.

 This messaging radio with an old familiar interface plays voice recordings of loved ones thus stimulating the feeling of connectedness.  This design is both for the caregiver and for the loved one with dementia. Caregivers can send voice recordings via WhatsApp (common used messaging device in The Netherlands)- for example recording a message with the sounds of the sea on the background. A loved one with dementia can play these messages on the radio by switching the knob towards a picture of a family member- which illustrates there is a new message by a blinking light. In this way new technology is covered by a familiar interface  A prototype was created to test the concept in-context. With this we have seen with one couple- the person with dementia was happy receiving messages directly- rather than via his partner. Also- the messages were played multiple times and in addition both felt very thankful for receiving personal messages from loved ones especially for them. We would like to extend the time period of testing and also increase the number of participants- to get a better understanding of their opinion/experience.  It would be interesting to create an easy platform to be able to test this idea in multiple cultural contexts. In this way we can share experiences and make it adaptable to different needs and wishes. Next to quick & low-fi prototyping- we would love to improve the prototype into making it more reliable. For this we need a technical person who could program a stable programme.

 A fun gaming app that develops core competencies needed to prepare individuals to become smarter- better- happier carers.  Our proposal is aimed at both professional carers and family members who care for loved ones.Our aim is to enable carers to overcome those individual levels of 'unpreparedness' that restrict their ability to provide care.This is done by developing specific core competencies within individual carers by exposing them to various ‘threat rehearsal’ games on an app.We believe that using this app for 10-15 minutes a day will produce positive personal growth within the carer.  We are permitted to test our solution at a nursing home in Sussex- UK housing residents with dementia.This gives us access to professional carers and family carers.We test in 3 stages:1.Implement our solution using face-to-face questionnaires- profiling and physical games/puzzles (no technology). 2.Positive feedback is used to gain further funding to prototype the app which we will also test at the nursing home 3.Upon success we scale the app and launch it to the public  We welcome various forms of input from the community: (1) Feedback on our proposal is the best way for us to improve our design (2) App developers that wish to contribute their skills and ideas would be helpful (3) Providers of care who wish to host our solutions during early testing would be of great benefit (4) mentoring us on how to launch our enterprise is always required.  0-3 months  An Individual  Our team is made up of 2 people.My specialism is in social enterprising- psychology/psychoanalysis- change management- organisational design- design thinking- UX- socio-technical analysis and action research.My business partner is a MBA and CIMA qualified management consultant. ,0,0
 A smart memory assistant app that tells users and families when patterns of life change and links everyone to the right resources for them.  Prompt is designed to adapt to users’ and families’ needs as a dementia journey continues. Initially- it helps users maintain their own confidence and independence and adapts to invite more family support as it detects life changes. Users and families are provided with links to local support groups- networks and helplines each time change is noted. This provides a personal contact point for peer support- a better insight into current and future needs as well as an outlet for emotional release.  Explore current local resources and determine if they need expanding or augmenting. Gain permission to share contacts Ensure people in my community have downloaded the app Add a notification service to the app suggesting local contacts based on current location Track responses to notofications Gather feedback  The first version of Prompt by Memrica is on the app store- feedback and suggestions for next steps would be hugely appreciated. Input on the right level of support at the right time and building resources that are accurate- valid and digestable would be very valuable.Familieswho are currently on this journey and who would be interested in co-design- please get in touch! Long term- the service must be sustainable- so thinking on commercial models is welcome.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm An Individual  I started Memrica when I couldn't find a solution for a family member. Previously I led strategy for games for health for a UK developer-partnering with the US Dept of Defense. I helped set up the UK's Serious Games Institute have worked in government policy and started my career as a BBC journalist  Prompt is a dementia friend in an app for people with early dementia and their families. It combines a visual diary with context about people and places in reminders with access to in the moment help and information- which are offered when the platform detects changes in patterns of user behaviour.  The current model is to offer the visual diary app for free for people living with early dementia- with an additional small subscription charge for premium services such as family access to analytics that show patterns of behaviour. To date- this has been modelled on £5/$6.69 per month. Feedback from user groups suggests this is affordable and families are willing to pay for peace of mind. An alternative approach is to attract sponsorship from companies who wish to support people with dementia.  The app stores are powerful distribution services; clever marketing is essential for discovery . Translation into multiple languages in the long term will support global reach. Sourcing and collating online information can be achieved through intelligent search. Connecting communities for meaningful- personal support is more challenging; initially we will tap into current support networks to link users to help- and long term will develop local groups of people willing to share their experiences.  Our aim is to keep people with dementia socially active as long as possible- which will help them feel well and in control- which in turn will reduce stress for families. We can use analytics to track patterns of social interaction- baselining when users adopt the app and measuring change. We can compare aggregated results against current known patterns of social decline. We will also ask family users to track their feelings- using emoticons- to see how mood changes when they access support.  The Prompt app is currently iOS (iPhone and iPad) only- we will be reworking the technology so it can be delivered to any platform- with Android and a web/browser based service for families as priorities. We will be upgrading the analytics to improve the way we can interpret a user's behaviour to see changes and also to predict what they will need. Community tools will also be developed to start the process of building a support service. ,0,1

 A compass that always points home. Enabling people with dementia to go outdoors on their own and offer space for their caregivers.  Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me! Appthereby provides the opportunity for the caregiver to have more quality time with their loved one or for themselves.  The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application.  We would like to constantly reflect with the community on the steps taken in our iterative design process. Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas. Later- we can find other test locations in the community.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  The PIT team consists of several professionals: - Maaike Thissen - professional caregiver at Pleyade - Rens Brankaert - professor at TU Eindhoven - Serge Offermans - technical & interaction designer - Hugo Nagtzaam - designer - Jaap van den Elzen - designer - Tijmen Stroeken - creative mind  Watch me! Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time.  We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them.  The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world.  We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application.  After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me! App worldwide in Google playstore (Android) & App store (iOS) as soon as possible. ,0,1
 Collaborate with educators in social work- art therapy and teaching to create a model for companion care for people living with Alzheimer's.  For families of patients with Alzheimer's- finding and training companions with the requisite education and maturity is fraught with challenges. Working with educators in the SF Bay Area- I propose to explore opportunities to recruit students in art therapy- gerontology- teaching and spirituality as interns to help fill this void. By focusing on activities to engage the patient- the intern will gain real world professional experience- and simultaneously offer respite to the family caregiver.  Identify one or two institutions with studies in art therapy and gerontology to explore prototypes for companion care.  Identify priority targets among educational programs where potential student internships can be created or expanded.

 An online toolkit designed to help caregivers plan for and manage their new roles  This idea is designed to specifically support first-time or inexperienced dementia caregivers through their journey of caring for someone else by providing information and resources to understand- plan- and manage caregiving for dementia.  Create a mock up website to design the structure of the toolkit along with preliminary information outlined in the structure of the site above. We would work with professional/experienced caregivers as well as doctors- centers- and communities to build out the content - making sure that everythingincluded is intuitive- practical- relevant- and understandable. We will then run a pilot to test our assumptions with current (to see if they would have found this valuable) and new caregivers.  We think it would behelpful if we can have proven and easy to use tips- resources- strategies- or approaches to prepare for and manage the role of being a caregiver.

 By asking the right questions- Hello Rita! makes it easy to create photo books that celebrate memories & serve as a guide if feeling lost.  Hello Rita! is designed with both the caregiver and the individual with dementia in mind.Throughout the process of creating the photo book- on-screen prompts guide the caregiver through uploading photos and having meaningful conversations with their loved one with dementia. Reflective conversations are interspersed with tactical care planning prompts. The resulting photo books serve as comforting momentos for the individual with dementia whenever they feel disconnected or lost.  We could go draft up a conversation guide on paper (as opposed to the full online system) and ask for caregivers’ input.  The intention behind Hello Rita! is to balance the soft skills of story telling with research backed methods.

 Senior focused training- on many easy to use tools like voice-activated speakers and tablets- will benefit seniors and caregivers.  Technology is frequently thought of as too complex for seniors. If taught in the right venue- this new technology can actually transform the lives of seniors and their caregivers. Tablets- smartphones- and voice-activated speakers can extend the time seniors can stay in their own homes- add safety- answer questions- replace safety monitors- provide entertainment (music- playlists- books on tape)- and even reach out to caregivers as needed. The key is in making the training accessible.  I would start with a small class at the local Senior Center- sponsored by a manufacturer to test not only the training but the devices as well. Based on that small test I would branch out within my local city to neighboring cities and other venues to determine the right size and space for optimum class responsiveness.

 An unobtrusive remote home monitoring system that can track and remind the care-recipients of their daily tasks.  Caregivers constantly visit their loved ones to make sure that they are safe and healthy. Their loved ones often feel interrogated and tend to lash out. This puts stress on their familial bond. With the help of Hazel- caregivers can check in on their loved ones anytime- anywhere- via a mobile app- granting them more personal time. It also softens the tension between both parties by allowing for better conversation during visits; something beyond menial questions like “did you take your pills”.  We have tested our sensors in a laboratory setting- but we need to retrofit our sensors in a few care-recipients’ homes and monitor them for a period of time to fully validate our methods. During these trials- we’d like to conduct periodic interviews to understand where we can improve our product design to better suit our users needs and preferences. We’d also like to conduct more discovery interviews with caregivers and care-recipients to better understand their daily struggles.  We would really benefit from hearing from the family caregivers and their care-recipients- and in general anyone with experience in this industry.

 Behaviors can be prevented by engaging individuals with dementia in meaningful and purposeful life activities using a Montessori approach.  Montessori for dementia helps care partners to be proactive- not reactive- when it comes to unexpected behaviors.The approach creates an environment where elders needs are met- enabling them to be more independent.There are things to do that match the person’s cognitive abilities and individuals with dementia are encouraged to develop daily routines and to do as much for themselves as possible.Their dignity is maintained and family and professional care partner stress is reduced.  I have successfully educated many professional long term care staff about Montessori for dementia- and recently began teaching home health care professional how to use the approach to help prevent responsive behaviors and engage individuals in meaningful activities.It has been very successful.I would love to work closely with a large number of families and help them to use the approach in the home and collect data about the success of the approach in relation to behavior reduction.  I would be interested in having advice regarding potential obstacles to success of this project: Family members of people with dementia are stressed and over burdened.How can we convince them to invest time to try something they have never heard of before? Would family members be willing to spend time learning the Montessori techniques?What are the best methods of data collection in the home?Would family caregivers be a reliable source of data?  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  I’m Jennifer Brush- and I’m on a mission to redesign dementia care. Whether I’m assisting a family in-home or leading a live training for a long-term care community- my work centers on one thing and one thing only—focusing on what individuals with dementia can do. ,0,0
 An intelligent reminder app to aid early dementia patients in completing daily tasks and to reduce dependence on caregivers.  Companion is an intelligent reminder app designed for people with early stage dementia and their families. By easing daily struggles of early stage dementia- it aims to allow patients to be self-sufficient for as long as possible- to remain at home and to help sustain their current lifestyle. Companion collects user information and makes intelligent predictions- aiding them in routine tasks such as paying phone bills and grocery shopping. This eases the responsibilities weighing on caregivers.  Initially- we will reach out to local caregivers of patients with early-stage dementia and divide them into two different groups. The control group will have the patients try out the app- while the other will not. Using the data and feedback we acquire from the two groups- we will keep refining the features of our app. Once we are confident in successfully augmenting caregivers’ efforts- our objective of increasing patient self-sufficiency will be satisfied.  Using design thinking inputs from the OpenIDEO community- we will use the feedback in the design of our app so that dementia patients can interact with the app interface as effortlessly as possible. Additionally- we will need as much help as possible in reaching out to patients- acquiring data- and testing our app in later phases of development. Any good product used by masses requires the input of many people and users to become a truly refined tool.  4 months - 1 year  A student collaboration  The team is comprised of Georgia Tech students with backgrounds in computer science- engineering and design. The combined skills of the team include- entrepreneurship- machine learning- cloud computing- front-end design and embedded systems. Using these skills- the team also competed in hackathons.  Companion is an intelligent reminder app to aid early-stage dementia patients in completing daily tasks- and to reduce dependence on caregivers. Using machine learning techniques- it predicts the user's needs and issues reminders accordingly- instead of passively waiting for their inputs. It also uses location information to decide when to issue reminders- tailoring them for each individual.  Our solution- the Companion app- is entirely software-based. It is designed so the app can run entirely on the user's phone- requiring no additional services in the background to support it- minimizing cost. Its accessibility depends solely on the user's access to smartphones. Dementia mainly affects those aged 65 and above. 42% of this age group currently own smartphones (http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/). This number is expected to rise rapidly- increasing accessibility of the app  The power of our app would grow as more people adopt it. The app is designed to run entirely on the user's smartphones- meaning as more users adopt it- they also provide the means to run the app. This allows us to scale rapidly. Instead of posing a challenge- this would actually provide us with more data on what features of the app benefited users the most. We could then tweak our machine learning models- release free updates to the app- and better serve the users.  The impact of our idea would be measured in terms of scale and effectiveness. Scale would entail the number of users who download and regularly use the app. This would initially depend on our promotion efforts. Beyond that- we hope that its sheer utility would advertise the app for us. Effectiveness would mean how much the app helped those who downloaded the app. If user surveys report that the app decreased their dependence on caregivers- effectiveness would have been achieved.  Firstly- we must finalize our app's architecture. We have completed the individual functions of the app- e.g. email parsing- text clustering. However- they must be put together to work cohesively. Beyond that- we need to find partners to work with- to gain initial traction for the app. We could work with caregiver organizations for this- or even government organizations dealing with dementia. Finally- once we have a sizable user base- we could work on refining the app based on user feedback. ,0,1
 The app's purpose is to establish a safety net/service system- that allows all users to provide a sense of security for PwD in society.  This service is designed mainly to support those around the loved one with dementia: nurses- occupational therapists- relatives or acquaintances- police officers- institution workers (from Associations or other companies invested in producing safe environments for PwD*)- among others.*PwD = People with Dementia  In order to launch this product in real practicality- it must be considered to promote it through Alzheimer associations- doctors- physicians and occupational caretakers. In order to produce an extended outreach with this service- one would have to further involve stakeholders- the SNS (Serviço Nacional de Saúde) and the Portuguese Order of the doctors. Advertising the service in newsletters- websites- pamphlets- and newspapers so that one may minimize the effects of the disease and promote it.  A work of this nature involves people with diverse skills- and therefore the results of the research need to be further improved in the various aspects of design- but not solely in those. Linking and partnering such product to either healthcare facilities or appropriated institutions would reach a higher visibility. Additionally- it is necessary to advance a marketing and business plan for applicability- as well as serve those who are involved in creating superior assistive technology.

 Measuring physical stress (HRV) in patients could help caregivers to understand their feelings- improve care-interventions and identify pain  My idea is designed for people with late stage dementia that have difficulty to indicate how they feel. Family caregivers can now see at what moments a loved one with dementia needs extra attention or experiences stress. This can help family caregivers to identify pain- to structuraly change situations that cause stress and to prevent stressful situations from escalating through early recognition. The direct user gains freedom- the caregiver understanding and stressors can be identified.  Firstly- I would like to use a readily available sensor to test the procedure on myself and peers.After this I would like to test an improved version on people with dementia and improve it further in a co-design session with clients and caregivers.A next step is exploring different contexts and purposes - how could the data best be interpreted? What kind of interventions are useful?  I am still looking for ways to create direct value for the loved person with dementia- and ways to visualize the data in a meaninful way. Next to this any ideas about or access to technology would help to create more reliable results.  0-3 months  An Individual  Student Industrial Design ,0,0
 A platform designed to inform- equip- and connect marginalized millennial caregivers with resources and each other.  Our Turn 2 Care is designed to equip young adult caregivers with simplified- culturally relevant information- access to useful resources- and opportunities to share their experiences with one another. Our hope is to offer a digital space for information and communication- a physical space for human interaction- and a space for opportunity- offering scholarships to those whose studies were interrupted or delayed so they could take care of their loved one.  I have gathered information from Atlanta-area caregivers young adult caregivers in the metropolitan Atlanta area and have received an overwhelmingly positive response. I hope to have a gathering of local young adult caregivers in early 2018 to figure out the best format for in-person gatherings.  I would like to gain access to development tools and subject matter experts. The information available about dementia in all of its forms is vast- and I want to offer pertinent information in simple- easy-to-understand terms.

 I am the coordinator and co-facilitator to help bring this idea to fruition. I have done this once before in the fall of 2016  This is for the informal caregivers. Outcomes of this program inlude:A decrease in the side effects of caregiver fatigue such as depression- stress- anxiety. Equip the caregivers with two to three skills that will assist them to overcome the side effects of caregiver compassion fatigue. Empower the participants with emotional and communication skills to help them communicate their needs and ask for help when they need it.  I would like to help bring a similar program to the Twin Cities metro area where there are an even greater number of potential participants for this type of program. I have identified some local therapeutic equine programs that would be willing to help make this happen. I know there are also many local support groups from which to recruit caregiver participants.

 It is an assistance for enjoying life when living with dementia.  There are two primary users: the patient and the caregiver. The idea is to create a platform that can enhance the daily routines of those users. Personalised programs that will be able to connect patients- caregivers and professionals.  It would be a great to get my idea tested. Initial users test to identify opportunities- to refine my concept to the specific needs that I am trying to cover with the mobile application.  Support from professionals. In order to build this concept- it would valuable to get support from all the areas involved.

 A physical and digital tool for people living with dementia to reminisce- recollect and reconnect with family and carers.  It has been designed with and for people living with dementia+ their family. They may be struggling to connect like they used to. Music Memory Box is a tool that can be completed together- going through treasured memories + music- it can be a conversation starter- family can hear stories they have never heard before. Laughter- love and singing can bring them closer. Once set up it can be used independently- increasing sense of independence or can be used in a group setting with family +or carers  We're currently running a 30 box pilot in and around Bristol- getting families and care homes to use our prototypes and give us feedback on the look- the function- how it's used- the benefits- how we can make it better for when we do the next stage - which is design for manufacture. We've done some work on this for our current boxes however the next larger batch of units will need to be CE certified- and the electronics developed into a single unit- we will need assemblers + suppliers etc.  It would be great to get a world wide perspective on the product so far- to see if the idea is transferrable to other peoples cultures and backgrounds. It would also be great for the members to share our idea- and give feedback about our films- we have done everything ourselves- with little funding but now it needs to look more professional. We are planning to crowdfund the idea next year - so any feedback now will help us with our films and how we communicate our idea. Do our videos make sense?  Over 1 year  An Individual  I created the first Music Memory Box back in 2011 for a family member with dementia- it started as a university project back then. Now I run a small social design studio that specialises in co-design + interactive technologies - we still need support- funding and partners to help launch the product.  The Music Memory Box is a physical and digital tool for people living with dementia to reminisce- recollect and reconnect with family and carers. Through use it can reduce anxiety- increase communication- independence and wellbeing & sense of identity that culminates in a higher quality of life for those living with dementia. The product has much market interest- but we need investment to launch.  So far we have found that care homes are willing to purchase the Music Memory Box for their residents- so an individual doesn't bear the cost of the product. One care home wishes to joint purchase the product (when its ready) with family- 50/50 - this is an interesting model. It is worth pointing out that as the batch sizes we make increase that we can produce a more affordable product. We also want to build a online community where people are sharing their stories- tips + ideas around the MMB.  The product is designed to be personalised- therefore is easily transferrable to other people and cultures. We have already been working in other countries to see if the product has ability to scale- we worked in Japan- Kobe for a month iterating the product with families and care homes there. Also a key place to scale in is the US where 5.5 million people live with dementia- more than 6 times the amount than in the UK. Our aim is 4 anyone across the world to be able to buy and use our product.  In our 2 months pilot we've been evaluating the impact before- mid and post pilot- but it would be great to carry this on for the final product. Care homes and families could fill out short questions about the product- so we can evaluate how they are doing and make changes if we need to in how we are delivering or implementing the product. We want to know as much as possible about how people are using the product and how it's helping.  Our immediate next steps are three fold: Firstly to secure funding and investment to grow the team- so we can get to the next steps which are: carry on getting care home groups and families excited + ready to pre purchase the product via our kickstarter campaign we want to launch. Thirdly find more affordable manufacturers for the product- current quotes from the UK are too high- if we can improve our quotes we can drop the price of the product. ,1,1
 Multi-lingual translation/adaptation of existing educational media (ex. videos- factsheets) for cultural + linguistic minority caregivers.

 Proven cognitive stimulation model that enables patients with dementia to find themselves while alleviating the caregivers' burden  Our idea has been designed to support both the patient with dementia and their caregivers. Given the limited time that caregivers have left in their day to effectively perform cognitive stimulation with the patient- we have created a new role- and a formal training to support it- called Geriatric Family Monitors. The Geriatric Monitor visits the patient at least 2 times per week for a maximum of 90 mins. each time- generating great results both for the patient and their caregivers and family.  Our idea has already been successfully proved in our community (Caracas- Venezuela). So far- we've trained 86 people under our Geriatric Monitor program. These people are a combination of caregiversthat are now performing the role of the geriatric monitor themselves- as well as formal Geriatric Monitors that are part of our non-profit organization that have assisted over 13 patients- with positive results. Our monitors can provide the service in our own facility or inthe patient's house.  OpenIDEO could help us scale our idea by expanding our Geriatric Family Monitor training and principles into other markets such as the US. Also by helping us leverage technology to design part of our training modules online for self-training so other people outside Venezuela can also benefit from our cognitive stimulation approach remotely.It would also be great if LatAm- so needed of this type of initiatives- can count with OpenIDEO to empower enterprises in our communities and language  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  Gisela López is a Graduate in Education and a PhD in philosophy with extensive experience in family counseling.

 The idea is to provide means of livelihood for unpaid female family caregivers and build the capacity of nurses to assist family caregivers.  This idea is designed for 10 female nurses who will be trained on leadership and management skills for caregivers and mental health management for dementia persons and 2 young women from the family caregiver will also be trained on economic skill acquisition and after which will be empowered financially to kick-start their own businesses as this boost their financial capacity and means of livelihood and also help avoid any mental stress for the family caregivers.  Providing the assistance of trained primary caregivers (nurses) to train and assist family caregivers and also improving the economic status of the unpaid family caregivers through skill acquisition and economic empowerment. When the caregivers have no means of livelihood- it could add more stress to what they encounter taking care of their loved dementia person. But ones they are quipped and trained to take care of their love dementia- it could curb frustrations and mental stress.  We will require the experience of the OpenIDEO on similar case and also the Facilitators from OPenIDEO who will help train the volunteer nurses who will in turn train and assist the family caregivers on leadership and management for caregivers. We also need the your contributions in the area of skill acquisition for the family caregivers and supervision throughout the project lifetime. Funds are also very essential in executing this idea.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  We have worked on the areas of entrepreneurship- healthcare- project designs and implementations.  It is vital to empower the less-privileged informal caregivers through skill acquisitions. Adequate training will be given to formal caregivers to assist the informal caregivers to cater for their loved ones with dementia. Our focus is on female caregivers because they care more for their families than the men.  Our idea is primarily is engineered to empower caregivers to effectively cater for their loved ones with dementia. Our idea is affordable- cost-effective- and sustainable in the present and in the long-term period. These secondary caregivers are empowered and have sources of income to keep going. All our approaches do reinforce the typical day-to-day lifestyle of caregivers- instead of digressing from it. We are currently integrating community participation by getting them involved all along.  During the research- consultative meetings- and community awareness- we had requests to expand our activities to other communitiesby the intervention community and other communities. We intend to expand this intervention to other affected families that were captured in the survey research.  The impact of our idea can measured by the following means. 1. The response from the distributed questionnaires. 2. The level of interest and commitment from the community. 3. The number of dementia patients identified through the research. 4. The number of dementia patients treated. 5. The number of both primary and secondary caregivers trained and empowered. 6. The testimonials from the members of the intervention communities.  1. We will go back every six months for post-project evaluation. 2. We will issue interviews to caregivers and members of the community. 3. Our team will hold annual meetings with these caregivers for the purpose of appraisal and greater efficiency. ,0,1
 Vytality mobile health app manages health conversations among family and friends- along with real-time vital data & predictive analytics.  This solution is for family caregivers- elders- patients and community so everyone can both give & receive the support they need. http://peakfoqus.com  We will show pictures of the app- or provide an early app prototype to family caregivers- those needing key vitals and help with tasks- for their feedback. With the prototype- we would track if and how they use it - plus any benefits gained - daily & weekly over a period of 4-8 weeks.

 We have created a cognitive assessment and training system by integrating piano playing mechanism and the biofeedback sensor analysis.  Our system can identify early stage dementia by assessing executive functions such as visual attention- inhibition control- spatial orientation capability- decision making based on visuo-motor encoding and working memory.We use numbers- colors and simplified music notation for spatial-motor instruction while consumer-grade EEG device tracks brainwaves and we correlate data to haptic response for analysis. It helps caregivers to track dementia progress while it induces plasticity for the user.  We have collaboration agreement with Neurology department of Hospital Santa Chiara affiliated with University of Pisa for clinical trial with 50 various stages of Parkinson's patients to help them monitor cognitive capability using our device (grant pending). We would like to also work with local wellness centers for the elderly as musical-cognitive activity for them to have fun and train their plasticity while the caregivers can monitor the cognitive state of their loved ones.

 Snow globe with audio and Spirit Boat symbolizing letting go in a childlike way holding the universe in your hands in the power of the now.  Care givers feel release by engaging a snow globe while practicing mindful observation in a compelling and tactile way.The globe has movement- sound- builds imagination- is mesmerizing- simple and fun to use.It speaks to how we hold memory as the boat holds the snow. Care givers join an on-line community of snow globe users telling stories ignited by this symbol and are invited to interact regularly for support.The Spirit Boat symbolizes the care recipient's journey in a magical way.  Using a normal snow globe while playing music- I can road test this experience in care facilities to access reactions and gather stories that come forward. Also I can give the care givers I knowa manufactured snow globe with the prompt to use it at the end of the day for a week. I will gather feedback to determine what can be modified or enhanced. The idea is to use the movement and floating metaphor to see if this can relate to various situations.  I have never attempted to manufacture an object therefore I need direction in making and beta= testing the first globes. I have made a very simple version of this for kids but they were problematical.

 Develop an app or website that provides a way for caregivers and 500-000 hospice volunteers to connect  The idea is designed for dementia caregivers. There are already almost a half million hospice volunteers in the US- many of whom have years of experience providing weekly respite for caregivers of dementia patients. These volunteers collectively have given thousands of hours of their time because they care and want to help. It seems only natural that they would be more than happy to share their experience with other caregivers- if asked.  I could ask around at a local hospice organization to see whether they have any ideas about this- and whether they'd be willing to explore it further.  The OpenIDEO community would be a great place to tap into for ideas around different ways to help connect the two primary actors in this use case. On one side are the family primary caregivers for dementia patients- and the patients themselves; and on the other side is the sub-set of hospice volunteers who have experience working with dementia patients as respite caregivers. What would be the best way to give the family members of patients access to these volunteers (and vice versa)?  0-3 months  An Individual  I've worked in and around enterprise collaboration/enterprise social platforms for over 15 years- looking at how companies can better leverage the knowledge and expertise of their employees.

 TechCare is a platform that connects family caregivers to technology products and services that can help them with their caregiving tasks  TechCare is designed for the family caregivers who want to explore technology solutions for their caregiving needs. Caregivers often operate under the constraints of time- resources and mental stress. Our goal is to address the following question for them: “What technology solutions are available today to solve my specific caregiving need and reduce burden?”. TechCare envisions to be a platform that connects the caregivers to technology products and services specific to their needs.  Our goal is to design TechCare centered on the need of humans- in this case the family caregivers. We want to better understand their pain points- technologies they are using and hurdles to technology discovery. Thus- we’re conducting the following experiments:1. 1:1 interviews with family caregivers of people with dementia.2. Regularly attend caregiver support groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. 3. Gather feedback from caregivers who are contacting us via our website and social media.  Community is key to TechCare - both family caregivers and technology providers. We hope to get inputs on: 1. Gathering user pain points 2. Connecting with technology providers working in this space 3. Designing TechCare to be centered around the caregiver in terms of content- capabilities- user experience and interactions 4. Making the platform Emotionally Intelligent beyond being Artificially Intelligent to achieve its goal of augmented care through augmented intelligence (human + machine)  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm An Individual  Our team at TechCare has extensive background in technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning- and application of computational techniques to problems in healthcare and biomedicine. We collectively have over 30 years of engineering and entrepreneurial experience.  How do you find technology solutions for your family caregiving needs? We are building a platform called TechCare- that connects family caregivers to existing technology products and services that can help them with their caregiving tasks and reduce burden. It is a free service that caregivers can use to discover solutions suitable for their unique needs.  TechCare as a tech solution discovery platform for caregiving needs is envisaged to be FREE. We are planning various directions of revenue going forward: 1. Fee from product developers to make their solutions accessible through TechCare 2. Premium services to caregivers for solution review- installation and tech support 3. Educational materials for healthcare providers and advocacy groups 4. “State of Care” commissioned analytics reports for organizations who want to obtain market insights  The need for reducing caregiving burden is pervasive among family caregivers. Being able to use TechCare is the same as the ability to use the Internet. With the increasing use of Internet and smartphones- even among the caregivers who are 50+- we plan to tap the total available market of family caregivers of people with dementia who have Internet access in the U.S. and in rest of the world.  We believe the real impact of the idea is measured in how many real problems were touched by TechCare. We plan to measure this through various quantitative metrics including caregiver feedbacks- total monthly active users- time spent on the platform and total number of engagements in terms of product favorites- comments and shares.  1. Extend reach out of TechCare to both family caregivers and technology providers 2. Assess the effectiveness of changes made to Prototype #1 from users 3.

 Carefully designed personalised products for communication- meaningful occupation and leisure for people with dementia and their families  The products are primarily designed for family caregivers to involve their loved one with dementia in personalised activities. Personalisation is seen as a way of attending to the uniqueness and personhood of people with dementia and their families while providing opportunities for meaningful communication so that social relationships are maintained. Products are designed to enable families to use their personal knowledge to personalise activities and/or the products- making them more engaging.  The products can be divulged in current local projects that support family carers. This is an opportunity to apply the knowledge on supporting use- towards the improvement of these strategies and of the products themselves. It will also be a starting point to understand how the personalisation service can work on a different scale than that of the doctoral research. Finally- it will be a way to gain more insights on what this online platform can be- what content is important to include.  It would be very helpful to get some input on creating a sustainable business model to implement this idea- as well as financial support. Insights on this idea and on how it could work in other context and countries would also be a valuable contribute from this worldwide community. Sharing experiences and examples of activities with people with dementia developed at home are also welcome.

 Improv training for caregivers- to help them adapt positively to the changes in their relationship and strengthen bonds.  Improv for Caregivers is improv training (improv games and exercises) for caregivers to practice and learn how to accept the unexpected- deal with uncertainty- respond positively to their loved-one with dementia- and generally utilize the principles of improv to strengthen the bond between them and the recipient of their care.  Building from the improv training I've led over the past 7 years and my experience and relationship with The Second City- I have already started collaborating with groups working with caregivers to put together a training specifically designed for caregivers. These beta workshops with small groups of caregivers will assist early in the design procesto get their feedback and reactions- and overtime build a robust training that can be trained to others to share in their caregiving communities.

 Using comics to share dementia care good practice and enhance empathetic management of a wide spectrum of behaviors.  Parables of Care is an existing project designed for anyone interested in dementia and dementia care- particularly caregivers and people with relatives living with dementia. Research has shown that comics have the potential to have a positive impact on the health and quality of life of people who engage in comics reading and creation- contributing to transform attitudes- awareness and behaviour and contributing to create new opportunities for empowerment and more positive behaviours.  In a way we are already doing this by distributing the comic and collecting feedback. You can read some of the early responses here https://blogs.city.ac.uk/parablesofcare/readers-on-parables-of-care/- Some of the activity on Twitter around the project- including responses from professionals and members of the public- are being collected here: https://storify.com/ernestopriego/responses-to-parables-of-care.  We employed User Centred Design methods to create Parables of Care- and we are keen on keep testing the comic and think about ways in which a series could enhance the initial project. We are keen on receiving feedback and ideas. There are many ways in which this project can be expanded and enhanced- for example using digital interactive technologies (a comics app to complement Care'N'Share online for example?).

 To provide a physical space like a hub where dementia carers can meet up to exchange experiences- knowledge and advice.  Many carers feel isolated with little time on their hands to find the necessary help. My idea is that local businesses and councils would sponsor a service - facilitating a meeting place for dementia carers to meet up. This would need to involve organisations like the Alzheimer's society- whose local dementia cafe (run by Dementia Champions) could look after their family member with dementia whilst the carers had some time out to chat to people in very similar situations to themselves  As a dementia friend I have helped out at my local dementia cafe- so I would approach the carers that attend this on a fortnightly basis to find out from the users whether they would use this facility and also to discuss with the various dementia champions whether they would be open to this. I have already gained positive feedback from local businesses and will be approaching both my local MP and Council members.  It would be very useful if others in this community had tried something similar at local level first as my idea is to spread this nationwide. Obviously feasibility is key and any advice is welcome.  0-3 months  An Individual  I use to work in finance- but decided to take a career break and study Computing- Information Technology and design at the Open University. ,0,0
 A toolkit consisting of small musical instruments designed to strengthen the bonds between caregivers their loved ones and family members.  One note is designed primarily for caregivers and their families. One Note is a toolkit that uses music as a translator to help caregivers understand the struggles their loved ones are experiencing. Support and resources may not necessarily be available at a moments notice. Having access to this kit not only provides engaging activities to help better understand dementia- but serves as a creative manual for caregivers and family members to assess their loved one's condition at each phase.  For early experiments- my main goal is to learn more about the current practice of music therapy and the techniques involved during therapy sessions. This can take form as workshops and user interviews to gather a list of challenges that dementia patients may potentially have. In addition- these workshops can also serve to better understand family struggles and how music can play a part in the process. From this-I hope to create a concrete plan of action for how the activities will work.  Being connected to the community of caregivers- doctors- and institutions to create opportunities for workshops- user testing and feedback of prototypesReceive guidance from the OpenIDEO community on concept validation and physical design of the toolkit  0-3 months  An Individual  I am an Experience Designer passionate about mediating our physical experiences with digital tools.

 Memory Lane by QMedic integrates music therapy- including your loved one's favorite songs- with a 24/7 two-way medical alert service.  Memory Lane is designed to re-engage your loved one with dementia with music & audio she loves- transporting her to a time & place where she was happy- curious- deeply in love and- above all- connected to positive emotions.Miles Davis could invoke the cigar-filled jazz lounge she sneaked into in the 1950s; Joan Baez could be that redeeming note of hope- blowing in the wind on a gusty night. Memory Lane enables family members to customize songs and record audio memories to spark her nostalgia.  QMedic would be able to leverage our existing managed care network and subscriber base in 35 states to run a pilot of Memory Lane with dementia patients.Ideally- we would conduct a triple-arm study over 6-12 months with one of our managed care partners: (1) Arm 1: would receive QMedic with Memory Lane. (2) Arm 2: would receive QMedic without Memory Lane. (3) Arm 3:would receive no experimental intervention.  Skills/Guidance needed: User Experience Designers- Biostatisticians for triple-arm study- dementia Patient Advocates.The success of Memory Lane hinges on successful execution across a diverse subscriber base of multi-chronic patients with dementia.There is tremendous social complexity to understand in the delivery of interventions and a UX Designer who values direct observational learning and empathetic design can help us architect Memory Lane in a way that is most impactful for members.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  QMedic has been in business since 2010 and we launched our first medical alert service in 2013.Some of our subscribers have been with us for 4 years and face tremendous health and social complexity in their daily lives.My favorite days at QMedic are when I'm meeting subscribers in their homes.  For people with dementia- forgetfulness tends to trigger both aggression and depression. There is overwhelming evidence that music therapy delivered at the right time can reduce aggression- depression and caregiver burnout.Memory Lane enables caregivers to schedule their loved one's favorite songs over a two-way 24/7 medical alert service- stimulating nostalgia when Mom or Dad needs it most.  QMedic's medical alert service is fully covered by Medicaid. Medicaid subscribers would not bear cost for the Memory Lane application--it would simply be included in their QMedic subscription.For family caregivers who pay for QMedic's service out of pocket- the incremental subscription fees of Memory Lane would average between $2-5 per month.These fees would maintain affordability of the QMedic service for caregivers and ensure that basic data and voice streaming costs are covered.  QMedic's two-way voice and data base station transmits data over the AT&T network and as the base of users scale- the marginal cost of streaming data/content comes down substantially- making it possible for Memory Lane to be a free or near-free application for customers.For low-income Medicaid subscribers- QMedic would offer Memory Lane for free.There are 9 Million Dual Eligibles on Medicaid- >50% of which qualify for full coverage of QMedic's service.  We would measure success using both qualitative and quantitative measures. Qualitative measures would include caregiver surveys at t=0-1-3-6 and 12 months evaluating loved one’s anxiety- depression levels- frequency of aggressive episodes- and levels of caregiver burnout. Quantitative measures would include surveys at same intervals quantifying count/dosage/frequency of psychotropic medication.  *Engage health plan partners to identify members and families who would be most receptive to and a fit for Memory Lane. *Test royalty-free audio content and personalized recordings to demonstrate proof-of-concept.*Run triple-arm pilot for 12 months and track metrics at 0- 3- 6 and 12 months. ,0,1
 We educate the uses and advantages of technology in order to prevent social isolation.  Our idea is designed for older adults to prevent the early symptoms of dementia. This helps family caregivers by connecting the loved one with their family that might live further away.  We have already hosted a trial class and got lots of feedback. After doing this- a lot of the older adults that took part in our class gave ideas as to what to teach and how to teach it. They thought this was a great idea because it is harder for them to stay up to date and be involved in their kids and grand kids lives.  We would like to know if it is difficult for you to connect with your parents or grandparents through technology- and if you would want these services implemented for your loved ones.  0-3 months  A student collaboration  I am 17 and work at TJ Maxx.

 Meaningful programming for people with dementia in grocery store cafes while their care partners shop.  Supports family caregivers by giving them 1) time to grocery shop; 2) peace of mind that their care partner is being meaningfully engaged; 3) time to socialize and form networks with other care partners with coffee afterwards.  There are several memory cafes in my town and neighboring communities. It would be relatively simple to pilot this by shifting the location of a memory cafe from its usual site to a grocery store for one week to identify any challenges that might come up. We envision building a relationship with a grocery store chain once the prototype is set- helping to spread both caregiver support and awareness- the memory cafe movement- and the reduction of stigma of dementia.  Marketing- large-scale partnerships with grocery stores- design of posters and logo.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm An OpenIDEO Outpost or Chapter  Our group- which met at the IDEO Open Challenge in NYC- has a range of experiences- including design- entrepreneurship- healthcare- and caregiving!  Caregivers need respite to do basic chores like grocery shopping- and to feel connected to their community. This concept gives them both meaningful community connection and a chance to shop!  Most Area Agencies on Aging have a dementia specialist who could help organize volunteers to run the sessions- making them free.Donations could help offset costs of any supplies needed for activities.  With one grocery store chain as a beginning partner- this idea could scale quiet easily.

 A collection of step-by-step activity cards containing instructions and suggested adaptations for quality of life enhancing activities.  Our client families have often shared with us how difficult they find it to start a meaningful conversation and connect with an aging loved one who may not remember one visit from the next. Quality of life activities like those you’ll find in Joyful Moments help reconnect older adults to what brings them purpose- joy- and meaning in life. These fun and easy activities were created specifically by our eldercare and therapeutic activity experts to promote holistic quality of life in older adults.  1. We would like to create resources such as videos- consultations and tutorials to help support family caregivers get started with Joyful Moments and encourage their continued use over time. 2. We would like to conduct two quantitative experiments to analyze outcomes: A online survey to rank the usefulness of the tool to evaluate increased joy and ease with activities of daily living.

 CareShare is a platform that connects Dementia caregivers enabling them to connect and learn from each other from the comfort of their home.  Leaving their homes is connected with a lot of anxiety for Dementia patients. As a result- their caregivers are extremely susceptible to this type of isolation as well. CareShare is a platform that creates a safe and engaging space for Dementia caregivers to connect with other caregivers to swap anecdotes- foster human connecting- break down isolation barriers from the comfort of their home.  With a prototype already well underway- I think that we’d be ready to do a larger scale experiment with caregivers. Open to suggestions for smaller scale testing.  › Topic curation: how can we tailor topics to caregivers so that this is not a replacement for a text forum? › Feedback on the formats: do these two make sense as options for caregivers? › Additional features: how might we better emulate parts of real life communication to make this an authentic experience for caregivers- while still providing them with something unique?  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm  I have been in the design industry for 10+ years.

 Striving for an environment where family caregivers are supported with story telling & sharing to experience meaning in life amidst chaos.  It is designed for family caregivers. They have to contend with hidden problems like cognitive deficits- unpredictable behaviour and personality changes in their loved ones and the consequences that put them at risk for harm. We believe this intervention explores their various moods and emotions and enrich their path in their long journey of caregiving. So- use of story telling through words and sometimes a song or a dance movement helps caregivers to make sense of where each one is standing.  We would like to get feedback from 50+ family caregivers of someone with dementia. We'd - collecting their feedback after every session ( 25 one to one as well as 25 group sessions ). We would use personal as well as traditional folk lores for this intervention. And- we would then use this information to refine our strategies to better support family caregivers in future.  We are interested in exploring partnerships with organizations who use storytelling & sharing to support family caregivers. We are also eager for support and help in implementing this intervention in a large scale across India. We also need help in identifying funders- ways of marketing it to the community- and research in identifying best practices for this kind of intervention.

 The Weal Life app brings people together during health challenges to amplify human connection and make caregiving a more seamless experience  Weal Life mobilizes support for caregivers and anyone going through a health challenge themselves. We used the Refinement Phase to better understand how the app can support a family caregiver for someone with dementia. Our first round of feedback showed that caregivers spend less time thinking about their own well-being and would like help with daily care coordination to spend more quality time with their loved one. We prototyped and tested a model for supporters to make offers of help (below):  We conducted usability testing with family caregivers of someone with dementia and hospice social workers that work with patients with dementia frequently. This included 30-60 minute tours of the Weal app over the phone while they talked us through their reactions to the app- then a User Journey Line exercise to document the highs and lows of using the app. We learned that providing context in the app about using Weal is very important for family caregivers of a loved one with dementia.  We are seeking feedback from family caregivers to refine our beta product. We are interested in potential partnerships with organizations that are in-line with our mission. We are also open to guidance on our go-to-market strategy in preparation for a 2018 public launch.  Over 1 year  An Individual  Keely Stevenson is an entrepreneur and an investor. She is CEO and Co-founder of Weal Life and has served as a board member- mentor and advisor to start-ups and established companies in healthcare- biotech- energy- education and finance around the globe. http://skoll.org/contributor/keely-stevenson/  Caregivers of a loved one with dementia need support and care just as much as the patient themselves. When people in their network can help with the daily logistics of caregiving- then caregivers have more quality time for themselves and their loved one. Weal Life makes it easier for supporters to make offers of help to caregivers and assure them they're also being cared for.  The Weal Life app is free to anyone who would like to use it.It can be downloaded to any Android mobile device or iPhone via the links below:Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weallife App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weal-life/id1156682923?mt=8 Weal Life is also a public benefit corporation.  Our vision is that everyone can use Weal Life at some point in their lives. The app is designed for anyone dealing with any kind of health challenge- anyone who identifies as a family or medical caregiver- and/or anyone who would like to be a supporter during a health challenge. The app is designed for any iOS and Android mobile device- with versions for tablet and desktop in the pipeline.  At Weal Life- we believe impact means more human connection and well-being during challenging times. If our tool provides this value to patients- caregivers and their supporters- then we expect to see this reflected in the number of downloads- the number of members on Weal teams- and the level of usage among teams. Over time- we plan to measure the impact that the support Weal Life mobilizes for family caregivers and patients has on health systems- influencing care models and for employers.  If we are selected for the Final Feedback phase- we will focus our efforts on developing a flow for family caregivers to respond to Offers that meshes with the supporter flow we've developed and tested during the Refinement Phase. We are also focusing on partnering with similarly-intentioned organizations to develop experience roadmaps with protocols for support during various health challenges. ,0,1
 Conversation cards specifically designed to improve communication with a loved one in any stage of dementia.

 Publish booklets- and offer gifts to market; and make everyone conscious enough to become passionate about caregivers and the loved patients  This idea is designed for all family members and for the caregivers. It makes everyone understand the challenges; that stresses- the caregivers face. It makes caregivers' physical and mental conditions understandable to other members in the family and society because it makes everyone aware of the peculiarities - changes in behavior- ability to remember- temperament- fickle mindedness- hallucination- start to take place. In addition- it guides how to react and care for a loved one with dementia.  Initially it plans to make the booklets available in bengali at doctors' and the community health care providers' chambers.Simultaneously-some families having someone with dementia will be observedto make an assessment of impact on the caregivers.  Any efforts in developing effective contents to be translated into Bengali-and co-operations or suggestions in publishing the booklets acceptable by the expert groups will support the project.  0-3 months  An Individual  I didn't have relevant work experience but I saw the peculiarity of the attitude of loved ones and how that become stressful for caregivers; and I felt the knowledge about dementia can help everyone to understand and manage the challenge better. ,0,0

 Care Better is a platform and app connecting caregivers of loved ones with Dementia to each other & a Virtual Expert Marketplace on demand.  Care Better is designed for the family/friend caregiver. Our culture has changed in our loved ones often live far away- there are more non-traditional caregivers and caregivers lunge from crisis to crisis- looking for support. Googling only goes so far. Our research showed caregivers want 2 things. 1. To connect with someone like them who understands 2. Find a non medical Expert who can answer a question or provide a service when needed. Through a simple app- caregivers can find both.  We have built a small MVP of our product and have started a closed beta test.  Growing a community of dementia caregivers is our first effort. How to identify caregivers based on age- disease type- stage and relationship to loved one is challenging and requires IDEO's expertise in crowd sourcing and collaboration.Vetting and scaling our DVM Experts through their association memberships and utilizing social media should be tackled in tandem.

 Develop a way to allow caregivers to see and be alerted to abnormal vital sign readings of care-recipients utilizing wearable technology.  The Digital Caregiver program is designed to assist caregivers by recording vital signs of dementia individuals 24-7 and alerting them when vital signs fall outside of the norms.  10 caregivers of Dementia individuals can volunteer to receive a wearable device which would record vital sign data for 3 weeks.This data would then be analyzed to see what alerts were transmitted to the caregiver and if the alerts in any way assisted the caregiver in making better health care decisions.  We are in need of putting together a monitoring system where all wearable data would automatically be synced up.We would definitely need input guidance and skills in putting this system together.

 Joint art-classes with young children and Alzheimer's/Dementia patients  It is designed for both the caregiver and the family member. The idea can bring joy to the family member who might not have the opportunity to engage / be in an environment that reminds them of an earlier time. It also gives the caregiver an opportunity to enjoy themselves in the class and be a part of the community vs. alone at home with their loved one.

 An App to enhance communication between caregivers and care-recipients- and to reactivate and restore memories.  The app addresses mainly caregivers- who are looking for gainful activities for their loved one- which might give benefit to both: The dementia patient- who experiences more self esteem and wellbeing- and the caregiver supporting him/her with something personal. It can also be part of an ergotherapeutic session.  We have built a prototype and had several test-runs with real content. The testing scenarios where settled in:- a dementia daycare center in Munich - a practice in Berlin- where they focus on biographical work as dementia therapy  It would be very helpful for us- to get professional insights on biographical work as part of dementia care in other countries. And also to get to know if maybe others abroad are working on similar approaches. Also (if it is feasible) we would like to do additional tests in other environments.

 Simple and Easy to use Multi Dimensional App  For all those caring for a loved one with some sort of Dementia. Being fully aware that this is not a first (nor will it be a last) suggestion of this nature......and not wanting to re: event the wheel just add to what possibly already exists- my father and I thought a simple and easy to use ‘multi-dimensional’ app for caregivers....adapted for cell phones- tablets and computers (pretty much 100% of people globally have one or more of these devices) would be a life saver.  Invite a group of caregivers to trial the simple...easy multi dimensional app. for 6 - 12 month period. Gather data and feedback at the end of this period from those that participated to see whether idea is viable- helpful- useful- cost effective....

 Art projects that are specially designed to engage people with dementia and to provide caregivers a chance for respite at the same time.  My kit is designed for people with dementia and for their caregivers.I was inspired by current research showing that creativity remains intact until the last stages of dementia- and motivated by the lack available products based on this research. The result is a set of engaging activities for the loved one to do- which also provide caregivers with time for respite.  Over the last year- I tested the art kit in different settings (homes- senior centers- senior housing- etc.) and have adjusted the activities based on these tests.Now I would like to continue testing it- but with an emphasis on including caregivers in the process to a greater degree. I would like more feedback on how caregivers see the best use of the kit (what times of day or settings work best- what kind of introduction the caregiver needs to get started- etc.)  I would really appreciate the OpenIDEO community’s help with how the kit might receive more visibility and a wider audience.While we are doing this- I would also very much welcome assistance on how to make the kit more user friendly- and whether there are things I should add to the contents of the kit.

 An evidence based assessment- intervention & care plan system designed to support the mealtime experience for people living with dementia  Nutrition & hydration mealtime care is one of the most complex daily caring tasks with family carers reporting a lack of resources to help and increased anxiety at mealtimes. The DMAT can be used by anyone caring for a person living with dementia- from an unpaid family caregiver to an allied health professional. Based on research evidence- best practice guidelines and clinical experience it empowers carers with the knowledge and skills to create a person centered mealtime care plan.  Trials have already been completed in acute and community healthcare settings when the DMAT was a paper based version but this was mainly with healthcare workers and I would like to collaborate with charities and universities who have access to family carers using the full version of the DMAT web based software. Initial feedback from paid carers is very positive in terms of improving caring skills- the need for the product and its simplicity. Collaboration help via OpenIDEO is warranted.  I believe the community will be able to offer me a vast amount of guidance from their experience in setting up similar web based solutions for other social and healthcare problems. My skill is translating complex scientific information into practical solutions for family carers that can improve the quality of life for both carer and person with dementia they care for but I lack the entrepreneurial and design skills to turn the idea into something that will benefit a great number of people.

 The Voices of Dementia brings together people’s experience of living with dementia- through a series of audio diaries.  Serving as a public record- the day-to-day reflections of people living with dementia are captured. Our aim is that by opening up their lives to the public- we will improve understanding of the diverse experiences of living with dementia and how communities and services can best offer support.

 Employ creative engagement strategies to provide needed respite and also offer meaning- purpose- and joy to people with dementia and carers.  Family caregivers need high quality respite programs that can be provided by well-designed adult day services.New models of these services are needed that affirm personhood of persons with dementia and that recognize the significance of relationships- not just between those with dementia and carers- but also with others in the community.These kinds of relationships can be nurtured through various arts programs involving all users of adult day services and connecting them with community.  We have already done community arts programs and service projects at our memory cafes- but they are not meant to be respite- narrowly defined in terms of the care partner not being present.(Actually- they are respite- as some research has shown- because care partners can relax and enjoy themselves knowing there is no stigma attached to their loved one- and that supportive volunteers are present.)We could try this club idea one day a week for 6 months to see if it works.  We would need help in identifying funders for a program like this- ways of marketing it to the community- knowledge about state regulations regarding respite programs- selection of an appropriate site- recruitment of staff- etc.We need research help in identifying best practices for this kind of respite care throughout the world.The one adult day service we have in the area (Club Gabriel- at St. Paul Elder Services- Kaukauna- WI) is a great model; we need to talk about collaboration.  Over 1 year  An Individual  I had trouble selecting the origins of this idea because while I came up with it- I have worked closely for the past 6 years with community members to create a dementia-friendly community in northeast Wisconsin through the Fox Valley Memory Project.We have talked often about the need for respite ,0,0
 CAN provides access to elder care and dementia experts- resources to help guide and support caregivers and a social network of caregivers.  This idea is designed for caregivers of loved ones with Alzheimer's dementia- or memory loss. It utilizes an existing model of eldercare support in order to provide caregivers with access to experts who can be a listening ear- offer solutions- support in planning next steps and refer them to resources which they can act on now or in the future. A person caring for a loved one can often feel confused and overwhelmed. Being able to call or go online and get support can help solve that problem.  In the early stages- we can gather data from existing services within Optum EAP & WL and UHC Solutions for Caregivers to assess the frequency of individuals and cargivers who call for assistance related to Alzheimer's or dementia and survey them to find out if having access to a smart phone app and web based portal where they can interact with eldercare experts & other caregivers would be of interest. The initial data collection and survey process- could also help to identify a pilot test group.  OpenIDEO can be most helpful in terms of branding- marketing and development of the product along with integration among existing lines of services. I feel that AARP and UHC have the infrastructure to create- test and launch a new innovative product and service line of this nature and additional support to help leverage that from OpenIDEO would be really valuable. Especially if there are individuals- companies- developers or other stakeholders within this community that could contribute.  0-3 months  An Individual  I have worked for Optum in the EAP and WorkLife services business segment since late March of 2015 and am an elder care expert with experience related to Alzheimer's and dementia.

 Inspiration- encouragement- and creative prompts to create a collaborative journal with all members of the family & carepartner team.  This idea is for the entire care partnership- the person with MCI/dementia- the primary carepartner- family- friends- medical professionals- and anyone else who visits the home or care setting. It is portable- adaptable throughout the dementia disease progression- and can incorporate family and friends who live remotely or only visit occasionally. The collaborative journal becomes an object for conversation and interaction as well as a document of shared life.  As an art therapist- I have been working with individual older adults and their families using art journals for the past 7 years. I repeatedly hear from family members how meaningful the book forms are to them--especially because they incorporate the words- phrases- and statements of their loved one. The book form is a safe- familiar container--less intimidating and more accessible for those without art training or background. We will pilot test with family members in our memory care units in CA  While this project could run successfully with existing social media platforms- it would be great to partner with someone to develop a companion app. We would also be interested in partnerships around printing- distributing- and creating mail-distributed subscription programs.  Over 1 year  An Individual  I am a PhD art therapist and researcher. I have been working in healthcare since 2005 and with older adults since 2010.

 The creation of a dynamic- need specific- short term stay respite care program.  The idea seeks to serve family caregivers and those they care for- by offering a bi-functional program that's designed to offer extended relief from the care giving treadmill. The memory camp- a week long retreat- would serve each party in different but parallel ways. The program would offer engagement in the form of intellectual programs- physical activities- pampering and connecting with others. One lasting outcome would be a renewed sense of energy that's critical to navigating this disease.  As a caregiver to my mother- I have been researching local long term care facilities- looking for places that are open to and capable of providing a customized- highly engaging short term stay program that is aimed at presenting my mother with an opportunity to do and see new and interesting things- and concurrently- would give me an extended period of time to focus my time on doing something for me- knowing that my mother is safe and engaged.  Would love to get feedback from the community regarding already existing programs that are out there- and/or information on already existing programs and models that are similar in nature- but might otherwise be geared towards matters such as drug rehabilitation programs or cancer care programs that are focused on wellness and quality of life outcomes for patients- that also take into account the needs and role of the caregivers in those situations.  0-3 months  An Individual  I have a degree in Industrial Design as well as a liberal arts degree with a concentration in Sociological Studies.

 CareBot is an assistive technology for caretakers of elderly people with cognitive disorders.  CareBot is aimed at family caregivers and helps them by delivering suitable videos and information on care-taking in a conversational manner as well as on demand. CareBot also helps negate feelings of isolation by offering companionship- and emotional support- available at any time- anywhere- as it's important to maintain the caretakers' wellbeing for them to take care of their loved ones.  A qualitative analysis could be carried out to survey caretakers if they would use a bot like this to help their daily tasks and ask what features they would expect.

My contribution is designed as a advise that every caregiver wants to know and was never told.An early- lightweight experiment would be to give my contribution to new caregivers and get their feedback about what really helped them.

 Technology designed to fit onto a mobility aid to prompt an individual with memory problems to use their mobility equipment.  People with mild to moderate cognitive impairments who forget to use their prescribed mobility aid when at home.Thus- increasing the risk of falls. The system would provide caregivers with peace of mind when popping out for a short while (i.e. to the shops). Thus- this system will support the caregivers to continue undertaking activities that they need or want to do. It may also enable them to continue their care-giving role for longer (prevent caregiver burnout) whilst reducing risk of injury  A survey/focus group with potential users- family members and professionals could be undertaken to collect data on whether they feel that this would be a good idea and what additional features they would deem useful.

 Family caregivers receive reimbursement for creating content (blogs- podcasts- videos- conferences) that supports- educates and encourages.  My idea helps family caregivers of persons with dementia by providing them outlets to express their experiences while reimbursing them for the content they create. A family caregivers best resource is another family caregiver. On CareGiving.com- we put the focus on the voice of family caregivers. Family caregivers are our bloggers- podcasters and National Caregiving Conference presenters. When family caregivers become content creators- they heal themselves while helping another.  Family caregivers began blogging on CareGiving.com in 2009. Family caregivers have been sharing their stories through podcasts and video chats (as guests- host or co-host) since 2008. In addition- family caregivers began sharing their expertise through our virtual and annual conferences in 2015. Family caregivers have been connecting in our daily chats since 2011.

 Each day for 30 days a family caregiver receives a daily inspirational video message that supports them on their caregiving journey.  Caregivers face challenges not only at home but in the workplace. Caregivers suffer worsened health and more stress and strain than non-caregivers. More than 40% display clinical signs of depression. Sadly- family caregivers sometime predecease the one in their care. These 30 messages inspire- educate and reduce stress for caregivers and provide a daily moment of Zen. A persona like Lee- who has lost some of his social supports- could benefit from these daily messages.  Would be willing to work with partner company to offer to family caregivers to preview and test.

 A virtual caregiver summit with top experts addressing important topics in taped interviews streamed on any advice available 24/7.  Estimates show that 50 million people worldwide are living with dementia. In short order- family members become caregivers- overwhelmed with information and emotional pressure. The role becomes more demanding as dementia progresses- impacting their own health. We provide online- on demand videos by leading experts in organized topics to support caregivers. Your caregiver fit plan is always available- delivered virtually on any device- continually refreshed and curated on your personal dashboard.  We have launched the Summit Website and people are signing up and paying. This is a validation of our core offer. A next step would be to show that the model and services work in the business model outlined. We would do a test and survey of a Fortune 500. We see a clear win-win scenario here. Summit can be delivered through employers who make the Summit available as a value-added benefit to caregiver employees. They comprise six of ten workers and 25% are Millennials.

You're starting to see mom forget. Or she was just diagnosed with dementia.You need advice NOW. Where can you turn for concise- relevant information from trusted experts to navigate your journey? The Caregiver Smile Summit. Video interviews with well-known experts- skill-sharing- self-care- practical advice. Online. All the time. Available from any device.  We need organizations. 1. Health Insurers. When you give a caregiver information to better manage their life- you reduce stress and disease. This reduces health costs. Give as a member benefit. 2. Hospitals. They need help engaging caregivers whose input is vital to quality and safety. 3. Employers with caregivers should invest in the Summit as a way to reduce risk- educate in their community and provide a leadership role that shows they are brands that boost people and not just profits.  The technology infrastructure is already in place and because it is an online service- scalability is already built in. Should we work with insurers- hospitals-employers- government- we can private label accordingly. The 53 existing videos are just a start. We plan to add more as we identify topics and experts and also have end user input into topics. Video interviews are time intensive. To scale- I would train others and partner with existing content providers whose material we could license.  On a individual purchaser level- we can certainly develop a survey that measure key metrics before watching and after. It gets trickier when you scale. We could work with employers to measure retention and morale among identified caregivers from a baseline. On a broad scale- hospitals can measure PR- readmissions- and other metrics but not all will be attributable to the Summit. We would need to specifically survey and measure health outcomes of caregivers who engage. Same issue with insurers.  Frankly- OPENIDEO has encouraged me. With only 100 registrants- the time/cost value had me wandering if it was worth it. This validates the concept. Still I need to consider whether to go back and market the Summit as is or let it stand while I approach the target industries noted above for scalability. I frankly need the validation from this stage to provide proof of concept to giant corporations- who often don't see the direct value (read-revenue) that programs like the Summit bring. ,0,1

 MemoryWell is a national network of journalists writing the life stories of those living with Alzheimer's and dementia.  MemoryWell's stories give voice to the voiceless. They help those who struggle to tell their stories- and families eager to capture fading memories- chronicle their lives. Not only can our stories help in-home care- but they can help build bonds between generations- giving children and grandchildren an engagement toolbox.  We have already done it! We are in half a dozen assisted living communities and we are piloting with a home healthcare agency. We also have been in talks with the Village2Village network and the Socrates Society about an intergenerational event with them- bringing together young writers and seniors looking to capture their stories.  We hope the design and user interaction expertise of the OpenIDEO community can help us improve the adoption rate and information transfer of our stories. People love our stories once they find them- but we want to make them easier for people to see- access- and use in the course of care.  Over 1 year  An Individual  Before starting MemoryWell- I was a journalist. For the last decade- I was a correspondent for TIME Magazine- where I remains a contributor. I also authored the 2016 best selling book- Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works.  MemoryWell grew out of my experience with my father- who had Alzheimer's. A few years ago- when I put him into a community- they asked me to fill out a 20-page questionnaire about his life. This made no sense to me. Who was going to read and remember pages of handwritten data points? I was a TIME magazine correspondent. Instead- I wrote down story. They loved it and it transformed his care.  By providing our core service over the phone- we aim to make the service accessible to all regardless of mobility issues. In addition- we have chosen colors and fonts in our design platform that maximize the ability of our profile subjects and members of the family to read and interact with our stories.  We are in the course of developing a platform that automates much of the management process of assigning and tracking stories- allowing us to spend more of our time dealing directly with customers and story content. We are also continuing to recruit and build our network of writers to allow us to write a larger number of stories simultaneously.  We won a Howard Buffett grant to study the impact of narrative on those living with Alzheimer's and dementia. Studies abroad show they build empathy and reduce depression. We believe stories can do more to address the use of prescription drugs and the immense amount of staff turnover we see in this space. With our study- we aim to measure some of that.  We have pilots going with half a dozen regional and national assisted living chains- including Brookdale- the largest provider of senior care in America.

 genusConnect is a mobile care platform that helps family members to work as a team when giving care to a loved one.  The genusConnect care platform is caregiver focused and puts a robust set of caregiving tools all in one place.By inviting family and friends into a network centered on a person of care- genusConnect helps all caregivers to be on the same page with respect to the care the love one is getting.This produces more consistent care for the person in need and alleviates stress on individual caregivers as they work together in a common goal.  We are currently doing pilot testing with various organizations in the Detroit area to test our idea with families in caregiving situations.  I believe that the OpenIDEO community will be helpful to push this product to the next level in many ways.From UI/UX to feature improvement- creative community exposure will be invaluable.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  The team developing genusConnect is comprised of entrepreneurs- design professionals- business specialist and IT specialists.The common denominator for all of us is that we have people we care for.We came together knowing there had to be a way to create a tool that will help in that process. ,0,0
 Music helps dementia patients recall memories and emotions.  Caregivers feel isolated and don't know what to do with the beloved one who is loosing more and more the ability of doing normal daily things. It would be great to provide to caregivers a pool of creative and stimulating activities they can do with the loved one with dementia. A scientific proven method is music. By playing the person with dementia music- they remember things. Music connects the caregiver and person with dementia emotionally (example: remembering their wedding day- first date).  I want to reach out to a caregiver of a person with dementia and try out the idea. I would also love to try out to involve children. So- to find a caregiver with a child / children and let them play with music with the loved one who has dementia. Music can come from a radio- cd player or also be played live. For example the grandchild can play music to grandma/grandpa.  I don't know anyone in Solothurn or Bern who is dealing with a dementia case. Maybe someone of the OpenIDEO community knows a family who might be open to try out the idea. Or even a Pflegeheim. It's not the caregiver but it can build a case to show caregivers what is possible with music.  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  I work in the branding design and strategy area.

 Program designed for dementia caregivers as alternative to traditional respite by encouraging and facilitating brief respite opportunities.  Respite care is vital to a family caregiver's well-being. Not only does taking a break help a caregiver alleviate stress and recharge physically- mentally- and emotionally- it can also make them a better caregiver.Respite Lite would support dementia caregivers who are reluctant to leave their loved one in the care of others. By facilitating brief respite options- dementia caregivers can take the breaks they need with minimal disruption to their household- likely increasing respite usage.  I created a prototype of the care bags and tested it with members of a dementia caregiver support group in early 2017. I created an online survey and the feedback I received from caregivers was positive; the contents of the care bags were less important than the gesture itself. Caregivers liked feeling appreciated.I'm volunteering with Soldiers' Angels in their Women of Valor program that supports the caregivers of veterans with PTSD. My care bag prototype will be tested here as well.  More input from family caregivers of those with dementia: what feasible- reasonable respite options they would use on a regular basis.Business Development/Partnerships: Finding interested partners who would sponsor the care bag contents. (i.e. Businesses that would donate gift cards in exchange for logo on bag.)Distribution partners: Care bags would need reliable distribution partners to make program successful. (i.e. Doctor's office- adult day care center- home health agency.)  Over 1 year  An Individual  I'm a digital journalist- author- and caregiver advocate. I've participated in a previous OpenIDEO challenge (End-of-Life.) I was a long-distance caregiver for my father- who had dementia.  Respite Lite is a program custom-designed for dementia caregivers who feel hesitant about utilizing traditional respite care by encouraging and facilitating brief breaks via care bags and an app.  Care bags do not need to contain expensive respite options. My prototype test demonstrated that personal recognition and a brief break from caregiving duties were most appreciated by dementia caregivers.Partners could offset costs by donating respite care items- such as gift cards- massages. (Example: The Paul Mitchell Salon school in Wisconsin partnered with the Alzheimer's Association to offer haircuts and free manicures/pedicures to caregivers.)  The assembly and distribution of the care bags could begin with a single organization or care facility and expand as resources allow. For example- if the Atlanta chapter of the Alzheimer's Association supported Respite Lite and found it to be successful- the program could expand to other chapters in Georgia- and then to other states' chapters.Respite Lite would require partners to sponsor the bag's contents- volunteers to fill the bags and volunteers to distribute the bags.  Each care bag includes a pre-paid postcard to provide feedback. There's also a Google Form that captures feedback for those who are more tech-savvy. Gift card numbers could be tracked to assess usage.I'm active in the dementia and Alzheimer's caregiver community- educating myself on what communities around the world are doing to assist caregivers and how that could be incorporated into Respite Lite.  To continue to refine the contents of the care bags- based upon caregiver feedback.Distribute another test batch of care bags to garner additional feedback from caregivers.Seek funding options and partnership opportunities to deliver the Respite Lite concept to a larger group of caregivers.Continue the promotion of Respite Lite and Respite Care Share though my websites- advocacy journalism- and social media networks. ,0,1
 A place where people with dementia and their care-givers can experience things in the here and now- together- on equal terms.  Sometimes it is better to work with what you have as opposed to strive towards an impossible goal. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease- it is pointless trying to regain brain function- memory of even personality traits. What we have left to work with is the Here and Now. Can we make the Here and Now a good place to be?  Find a local public space to try out some experiments; testing our procedural knowing. Invite people living with dementia and their carers- try and set up a participatory design workshop in this space.

 Providing mindfulness training to caregivers from the comfort of their homes while building a sustainable network and learning community.  Mindfulness-Based Dementia Care is designed for dementia caregivers.Caring for a loved one with dementia invariably includes an almost constant struggle with reactivity. Themes include (in)patience- grief and guilt. MBDC provides dementia caregivers with the skills they need to tune into themselves and the person in their care so they can approach the care exchange with more equanimity and (self) compassion.  We plan to invite a caregiver focus group to provide feedback on our initial recordings and materials prior to rolling out the program. Additionally- The Michigan Health Endowment Fund recently granted funding for a 2-year collaborative- multi-university project to create a caregiver wellbeing network in SE Michigan. This project includes funding for a live webinar and hybrid pilot of MBDC. We plan to include data from this project into our online project development.  We need guidance and feedback about best practices and support for growing technology (MBDC + additional mindfulness content) to reach caregivers/ care partners online and on their devices.We hope for this technology to be able to serve care partners where they are in the journey- to give them the tools to select their learning pace- the level of their interaction (pre-recorded information as well as live webinar) in addition to sensitivity to location and resources where they live.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  We have been in the field of geriatric/neuro social work for many years. We are both licensed (LMSW/LMFT) and mindfulness meditation teachers. We love this work and look forward to growing this shared vision for the transformative benefits of mindfulness in in the dementia care exchange.  This program is designed for caregiver well-being and enhanced perseverance.MBDC offers a suite of renewing practices for sustaining a healthy- safe- connected and resilient lifestyle while caring for someone with neurocognitive loss.The practices- both formal and informal- give caregivers the energy and ability they need to respond to their daily life just as it is and to be truly well.  Making the program available online and through smart technology not only allows MBDC to reach caregivers wherever they are- it allows the content to deepen and expand overtime - dynamic and living material- responsive to feedback and useful for the entire journey. Our goal is to offer the program for free to family/friends caregivers- though we do plan to elicit donations to maintain the online platform.  As a mobile and online community of support and mindfulness education resource- our idea has intrinsic scalability. The Mindfulness-Based Dementia Care program has been taught in several physical locations for three years now. We feel now is the time to scale it so more people can be reached and more people can benefit.  To measure the impact we plan to ask for online feedback from participants via instruments such as Surveymonkey or Qualtrics. Questions will include personal user perspectives- successes and challenges- feedback for improving ease of use and addressing specific practice applications in addition to topics such sleep- stress- and mood. In addition to program feedback- there are validated scales available which are also useful self assessment- reflection and growth tools over time.  Immediate goals include securing a contract with an experienced programmer. Ideally- this will be someone who can develop the website and app simultaneously.We are currently receiving quotes and project outlines to blueprint this year and necessary steps for sustainability with an online format including interactive capability and smartphone continuity. ,0,1

 Family caregivers can connect- share and comment on technological products that might support them and help with certain behaviours shown.  It is a maze when it comes to online caregiver support. The idea is that caregivers who are searching online for support and recommendations regarding certain websites- products /technologies used when caring for someone- will find one online community platform that summarizes all these websites and all these products.  Start a discussion thread on an existing online platform for family caregivers regarding certain websites that provide technological products. This thread will ask family caregivers what their experiences are- what they like and dislike with technological products- if they use certain products- followed by an an open discussion about using technological products for support.  The problem is that there are so many platforms- websites and online communities that it becomes a maze. The aim is of course that this online platform will not become just one of these many websites.I will need input from the OpenIDEO's community to overcome this challenge. However- because OpenIDEO is such a large international platform- this challenge can be overcome. That is- members can recommend and share this platform.  Over 1 year  An Individual ,0,0
 MouthLab- a non-invasive remote monitoring device that measures > 10 vital health parameters in 30secs essential for managing dementia pt's.  Vitals monitoring are essential for managing someone with dementia. Specifically- parameters like BP- ECG- respiratory rate- temperature- pulse rate and dehydration- are very critical in managing older patients with dementia or its co-morbidities. Specifically- infection is a common cause of increased confusion and pain in someone with dementia- which could be measured with temperature. Hospitalization due to dehydration is also very common with dementia patients. We helps caregivers to monitor.  We would like to perform a pilot study with 20 dementia patients & 20 caregivers- and provide MouthLab to collect daily biometric data. We will develop a prediction model and algorithm for dementia and behavioral analysis of both patients and caregivers based on MouthLab vitals data. This algorithm will be used to identify early signs of disease progression and with the assistance of providers we aim to provide right interventions and treatment strategies in real-time to avoid ED visits.  We are seeking assistance from the OpenIDEO community to help us put together a focus group to understand patient and caregiver needs as we design the final device/solution. We also would need inputs and guidance from OpenIDEO with respect to building an efficient real-time secure user communication system between the patients- caregivers and care providers. We also need funding and mentorship to help complete our pilot studies in partnership with the Memory Disorders Center at Johns Hopkins.  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm An Individual  Mr. Elumalai- CEO- has >14 years experience in healthcare- worked at Johns Hopkins Medicine- patient advocate and policy lead at PCORI.

MouthLab enables easy daily monitoring of vitals and alerts the changes in patients condition early enough to intervene and provide appropriate care. Through our real-time triaging software- caregivers are informed about the changes in patients conditions and help select appropriate interventions.CMS pays!  We would like to perform the initial pilot at Johns Hopkins- but using our close network with providers and health institutes at the Texas Medical Center- we aim to expand to more patient population. We also aim to work with CareMore team to target more patients within their member population. As a part of PULSE@Mass Challenge 2018 cohort- we are also working with Mass. eHealth Institute and would leverage their health network in Massachusetts to scale our solution to large number of people.  Using the pilot studies- our primary objective is to measure the impact of daily vital measurement using MouthLab by demonstrating the the reduction in the number of hospitalization & ED visits. We aim to improve the patient and caregiver satisfaction using the device. From a patient’s perspective- we want to show the ease of use and adherence. Regarding the caregivers- we want to show the changes in their health over a period of time and how it impacts the way they are managing their loved ones  1) Our immediate next steps after the challenge is to publish a whitepaper on the impact of MouthLab on dementia. 2) Use data & whitepaper to target other providers & health institutes to perform larger studies. 3) Apply for NIH grants in partnership with dementia experts to help expand on our disease focus.4) Partner with patient advocacy groups associated with PCORI for pilot partnerships. Ultimately- we aim to raise more funds to expand our device capabilities & team to commercialize MouthLab ,0,1

 A virtual visit with a friend designed to provide support- comfort and ease the sense of isolation for caregivers. A soft spot to land.  Social isolation is one of the biggest challenges for caregivers. Apart from the challenges of individual care- the idea that accidental caregivers have no idea what they need to know and what to expect in their new role.Warm- engaging videos that caregivers can plan to watch everyday can provide a needed break and provide support at the same time.  I have created a Facebook Page called Caregiver Coffeebreak and have received very positive responses.I am in the process of building a section of my current speaking website dedicated to The Caregiver Coffeebreak.I currently speak to groups about living in the Sandwich Generation and how to find humor and grace in that space.I have already recorded 15 videos and have gotten very positive responses from viewers on Youtube.

 Staying in touch with people with dementia through technology  1. People with autism 2. People with dementia 3. Cardiovascular Disease in the elderly To tackle the challenges- we developed a Mobile Application and an Online Web-based Platform used by caregivers and doctors to monitor and fully manage people with these complications. In addition- we have developed a health watch and a vest worn by the patient and linked to the mobile application and Online Web-based Platform. We have an ecosystem linking the patient- doctors and caregivers real time  We have identified the rural areas of Kenya where access to medical care is. We give the patients the health watch or vest which is connected to our mobile application and online platform. These are then given to caregivers and doctors respectively in order to monitor every move of the patient.

 VUI that interacts with a care-recipient- performing tests in order to provide the caregiver with reports on recipient's cognitive changes.  Myco is for a technologically savvy- data-minded- (and totally overwhelmed) caregiver- who may begin their caregiving journey long distance- and is caring for someone who has just been diagnosed with the earliest stage of dementia. Myco delivers quantified reports for the caregiver; which help by providing evidence to eliminate second-guessing- prompt conversations with doctors- plan ahead for upcoming decisions- and prioritize current levels of care.  Team value: Get feedback from pcp- social workers on the (prototyped) report as used in discussion with a caregiver and care-recipient. Interaction value: Test the experience of interacting with the VUI and participating in the tests for a month. Data-driven decision-making value: Provide a report to a caregiver who is giving care to a loved one in an early stage- or to a professional who oversees transitions from assisted living to memory care units.  The OpenIDEO has been very helpful with feedback and input. I appreciate everyone who has taken the time to comment and consider this idea. The idea has morphed greatly based on feedback- so I couldn't have done it without OpenIDEO. I hope to have the community's support in further iterations. Thank you!  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm An Individual  I have a background in human-centered design- and studied service design at Parsons New School for Design. I have work experience in service design research for healthcare such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center- and I have experience caregiving for my grandmother as she has slowly declined.  Caregiver's are expected- without knowledge or expertise- to manage a transitional period in loved one's life. Myco is a VUI app that supports them in this new role. By gathering data and providing synthesized reports- Myco helps the caregiver with decision making- doctor visits- increasing care responsibilities- and how to let family members know that it is time to act.  Insurance companies should see the viability and money-saving aspects of this app (with it's emphasis on preemptive screening measures) as most of healthcare costs are emergency based. The app itself would be inexpensive- and the data derived would provide immeasurable value for the science and research community.  Because it is a voice assistant applicaiton that situates itself between existing care-team members- it's ability to scale is unlimited- at least within english speaking areas. It could be translated to scale further- once the mechanisms were down it would be a matter of re-writing the language processing AI. At larger scale- the app is increasingly helpful as a resource for data for the scientific research/biostatician community.  The impact could be measured in total downloads- active users- and health care professionals who approve of- endorse- or recommend it to their patients and patient's caregivers. At a different or alternate level- it could be used as a company tool for social workers who work with large groups of residents such as those as assisted living facilities.  Developing a beta app that can be tested on a voice assistant device such as Google Home. Refining the report delivery and multi-platform functionality.

 A Caregiving Trajectory Plan could be a roadmap for care designed to spread responsibilities- not stack them- with disease progression.  As the saying goes- plan for the worse and hope for the best is essential to peace of mind for caregivers but perhaps more importantly- for those that someday may need support from their loved ones should the worse scenario become reality.Families plan for a wide variety of life events such as births- education- marriage- financial surprises- retirements and even death. How might we develop similar advanced planning strategies for long-term family caregiving  The first experiment would be to build a more formalized support team of siblings and grandchildren then determine a handful of core caregiving roles and spread them across the team. Finally- using existing technologies- cobble together an information sharing and communications platform for the team.  Two categories of ideas are needed: 1. What core caregiver tasks can be defined as areas of expertise to be assigned to and managed by a specific caregiving team member? 2. What bits of existing technology can be cobbled to create an effective communications platform that anyone can easily manipulate.  0-3 months  An Individual  I am an Architect and Product Designer ,0,0
 A digital hub in the home of the person with dementia enabling real time communication and collaboration between all of the care network.  The idea for Konnektis originated when Mark was attempting to care for his Grandfather with vascular dementia and experienced all the challenges of disjointed and predominantly paper-based communication. Konnektis has been co-designed with all different users- from people with dementia to families- professional carers and home-care managers. It empowers families to access- record and share information in real-time between families and carers- enabling far more effective and proactive support.  It would be fascinating to see how people could utilise it simply between the family network and person with dementia- without the inclusion of the professional carers. Mark found the crucial thing with his Grandfather's dementia was having the ability to speak to him about contextually relevant things- for example knowing who else had been to visit and asking how they were- but in order to do that you need the information.

 A one-click tablet platform that allows the user - early to mid-stage dementia patients - to easily access entertainment.  Designed for: Early to midstage dementia patients.How does it help: Care-taking is tiring- this app would enable a dementia patient to entertain themselves for a short period of time- providing respite for the caregiver.Why: I thought of this app one day when I was caring for Mom- after going for a walk- running errands- singing along with youtube- I was out of entertainment ideas. My Mom just looked at me like - what's next! I also wanted to find a way for her to read books.  I appreciate the positive feedback and suggestions. I've been thinking about next steps. I have some ideas - like adding more family memories via @Trän - and modifying options based on stages. For example- while my Mom still loves to sing- she is less able to watch a whole movie. My next step is to create a table with 3-4 stages- utilizing research from @mollyolberholtzer and others on this site. If I make it to the refinement stage I hope to make a working prototype.  I'd love input on: motor skills- recognition at various stages and to look at ways to evaluate app's effectiveness- ie. is user entertained and is the caregiver given a break and what we all want- a feeling that their loved one got some enjoyment from using the app.  Over 1 year  An Individual  Bio: Wendy Johnson Carmical has developed hundreds of books- toys- games- short films and e-learning modules for Broderbund- Purplemoon- Disney- Scholastic- and others.

 Family care giving is often challenging for the care giver- which leads to being cut-off from the society.  My idea is designed for a family caregiver. Like mentioned above- it is often difficult for family care givers to find time for themselves- as they are just so occupied physically and mentally. They are often feel left out from the society. It is important for us to make them believe even they are a part of the society and their life is no different to others. Therefore my idea is to create a social networking app for care-givers- where they could meet other people and other care givers.  Before investing on the application- I would run a a Facebook campaign to see the responses of people.A test run would also be done by a facebook page to see if people are actually willing to participate.  I would like ideas on how this could be made feasible. How difficult is it to make a mobile app- and how could we target the caregivers. How can we make it interesting enough for both- the caregivers and the non-caregivers for them to be actively part of the social networking application.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  I have studied entrepreneurship as a part of my masters course. ,0,0

It better supports caregivers by answering their primary challenges: planning- organizing- getting advice from fellow caregivers- answers to questions and a place where you can relax and let us help you.  Goal: Determine latent user needs Empathetic interviews (Stanford model) we conducted interviews with X caregivers. We guided the conversations but also let them talk about what they wanted to talk about. The basic idea was to listen to someone tell their story rather than to ask pointed questions so that we can find latent user needs in their experience.  We have identified that the two areas that are the most important for us to examine are convincing a caregiver to click on an ad and the ease of the signup process. We would benefit from having IDEO look at our sign up process to make sure the design is intuitive. In addition- we want to make sure we stage our product build logically and would like input into that as well.  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  I am a serial entrepreneur and the CEO of Cognotion- a company that trains Certified Nursing Assistants- Professional Caregivers- and nurses to care for the elderly. We use behavioral science to train people not only in the skills they need but also that their jobs are important and meaningful.  For the 40m people that care for an aging parent and struggle with managing care- finances and scheduling- ReadyCare is an adaptive platform that acts as a coach and community helping you to find the information that you need through our proprietary AI system and through peer-to-peer learning.  Our aim is to financially improve the lives of caregivers through multiple mechanisms: 1. With more accurate information caregivers will be able to save time and money and to plan ahead 2. Identification of services or tools that are covered through insurance 3. A low cost application that solves multiple organizational needs instead of requiring caregivers to pay for multiple apps.  80% of caregivers access information on Facebook and Reddit style sites--we want to give them a single destination.Most caregivers can't afford a health coach that will walk them through navigating health systems-but every caregiver needs this type of service. Our aim is to be the uniting platform that connects multiple services in one area and becomes the hub of family caregiving. We will only be a success if our product meets the needs of most of the nation and every individual's unique needs.  Right now only 7% of caregivers use technology based tools designed for caregivers. Our primary service is simplifying the process for them to access doctors- services and available digital tools. So if we can have a measurable impact on overall usage of services designed for caregivers then we will have served our audience.  Cognotion (parent company) has launched this new entity as a minority owned subsidiary.Our first steps are to1. Raise a seed round $250k (January-February)2. Hire a CTO co-founder (March) 3. Build a MVP that reflects the larger vision (January-March) 4. Test out price points and advertising language to assess our CAC 5. Iterate on the platform based on feedback (March-June) 6. Raise a convertible note bridge round ($1m) 7. Begin to form partnerships 8. Change the world ,0,1

 A home support system for patients in Early Stage Dementia- reducing some of the stresses that comes with short term memory loss.  The Dementia Home Support System is there to aid a person in Early Stage Dementia. The system relieves some of the issues that come with the condition- in particular- short term memory loss. The system looks to enhance friend and family relationships by perpetuating the users aspirations- identity and lifestyle.  The Dementia Home Support System has been designed with people in Early Stage Dementia with groups ran by Alzheimer's Society. The Dementia Home Support System appeared at New Designers '17 where it was received very well and gained lots of interest- as well as being entered for the James Dyson Award 2017.It also gained recognition from Design Council- where Sarah Weir OBE had something to say about it; http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/our-top-picks-new-designers  Anything would be great! I'd love to hear what people have to say and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask - I'll do my best to answer. Also- if there is anything you don't understand or I haven't explained well enough- please ask!  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  Recently graduated from De Montfort University with a degree in Product Design (BA) and currently working as a Product Designer.  The Dementia Home Support System looks to elevate some of the stresses that comeswith the diagnosis of dementia. The System supports both the user and informal carer through the adoption of modern technology- it's main features being locating misplaced items- answering questions and an additional safety feature for the cooking appliance.  The Dementia Home Support System Home Hub has been design for assembly and disassembly- not only to allow the parts to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way but also have the potential to have its internal hardware upgraded. Since the product could only be used for a few years depending on the users diagnosis and rate of deterioration- a monthly payment plan seems the most realistic and fair.  The impact of the Dementia Home Support System should be measured by the confidence and peace of mind it has given back to the the primary and secondary users.  After the Challenge- I intend to keep pushing to get my product out in the market in some form. There is a clear need for something like this and I think there is a big gap in the market for products for people in Early Stage Dementia. Pushing companies to become more dementia friendly too - it doesn't take too many changes to make products and services much more inclusive to people with dementia and other memory issues. ,0,1

 Make the family members know that the love return is necessary.  The idea designed for is the caregivers whose family has dementia people. My idea can help them enhance their social responsibility- and make them enjoy the environment.  Everyone love her/his own family - and almost all people have had education- so they can accept new idea . At the same time- when we tell them this thought they can connect to themselves- I think them also want their children love them.

 Professional writers capture short- digital life stories for people with dementia to help their families continue to see their humanity.  Family caregivers burnt out by all the things their loved ones with dementia can no longer do can lose sight of their loved one as a full person. This project is for them. Digestible life stories can change that dynamic by renewing caregivers' sense of empathy for their loved ones- preserving memories and providing an easy activity to do together. The stories also would help paid in-home caregivers (who often give family members temporary breaks) see the humanity in the person with dementia.  Through connections in the dementia-care community in Chicago- we could find families who would allow a professional journalist to interview them about their loved lone's life story. We'd then ask the family beforehand to discuss how they feel about their loved one. After the digital life story is created and published- we'd discuss with them whether or how they use the story- and if it's helped them understand their loved any differently than before.  I would love to hear ideas from the OpenIDEO community on the best ways to preserve a person's humanity online -- how do you best capture the essence of who a person is to build empathy? I'd also love to hear people's experiences caring for people with dementia- and feedback on designs for a digital repository for capturing the stories. Also- are there other activities or information family caregivers would find valuable to have on hand through this process?  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  I worked as a journalist for 10 years at The Wall Street Journal- and now I work in business research. I have an entrepreneurial inclination- and developed this idea through a discussion with a person I got to know whose father had Alzheimer's. ,0,1
 Gabriel connects members of the journey addressing social isolation and through detection leads to peace of mind for all members  My idea is designed for carers and cared and by providing a holistic solution of prevention and detection the whole team from children to aged participate in the journey. Social isolation being the main health risk for both carer and cared is the first target. Connectivity forms the foundation for peace of mind and allows remote monitoring and assistance which reduces onsite time for the carer to lead a more normal lifestyle.  The Gabriel system is currently being tested in homes in Australia and will be launched in the US in early 2018. Feedback is continually being received from a wide network of global experts and carers. Terry Crews the company founder is a Purple Angel Ambassador.  The community would be of great assistance in the launch phase in the US early next year. Gabriel is continually seeking new ideas and functions that can be added.

 Brain intracellular acidosis that affects the brain cells thus leading to Dementia can be managed with the regular use of Alkaline water.  The use of Alkaline Water as a solution for Dementias is a ready solution for all sufferers and cases of dementia but especially for elderly users and suffers whose systems could be highly toxic due to long years of indulgences in acidic lifestyle thereby compromising the brain cells and body systems. The use of alkaline water as a means of reducing and controlling dementia by caregivers could be done without much stress as the suffers are just encouraged to take the alkaline water regularly.  To test and prove the efficacy of this solution- after the discovery and perfection of the formulation Obique Alkaline Water- for the past two years now- we have been preparing it and using it to help many a sufferer of Dementia and other health challenges. The results have been very wonderful and awesome. It has been used to manage stresses- alcoholic handover and as well as handle other health complications among many in the Niger Delta region especially within Delta State- Nigeria.  To scale this idea and solution to larger Africa and global audience- we need solution testers from any part of the world to further prove the efficacy. Still- we need collaborators to research more on the phytochemical analysis and standardization of our raw material and secret ingredients use in the formulation. We also need people in the community to invest and produce our solution in any part of the world to help more people suffering from dementia through the use of alkaline water.

 A phone call service for caregivers to call when they are seeing abnormal or challenging behaviors from their loved ones with dementia  Caregivers have a ton of questions related to dementia care. With this service- they have two options: one- set up a date and time to call with the dementia care response team. A trained dementia care consultant will talk to the family member for an hour over the phone or video chat- providing tips and advice related to community living placement- challenging behaviors- or communication ideas. The caregiver can also call during an emergency for on-call- ASAP advice related to a behavior.  I offer a phone call helpline service where caregivers can set up a time to talk with me- pay $50 via PayPal- and then I will call and talk to them for an hour. I troubleshoot all of their questions and then send them a follow-up email with a summary of what we discussed. Families are able to talk to an expert in the field and get advice about anything related to dementia caregiving.  I'd love to take my idea to a bigger platform and make it something viable that I could even do- in the future- full-time- with a team of people. I don't know how to get it there! The UK has things like this- but it doesn't look like the USA has followed suit.  4 months - 1 year  An Individual  I have a Master's in Gerontology and run my own dementia care consulting business- Dementia By Day- LLC. I'm a speaker and author in dementia caregiving- and my book on dementia care came out last year with JHU Press.  I'm creating a hotline for caregivers to call- in emergencies or otherwise- when working with someone who has dementia. Be it in the middle of a behavioral issue- or because they want to help someone move in to a community care center- they have somewhere to call to get expert help. The Alzheimer's Association has a hotline- but I have not heard great things about it. I want something better.  This should be a federally or grant-funded program.  I already use this program via my website- and get calls from all over the country. I can help anyone- anywhere.

 Patients have a short time left after the disease is detected- some just pass-away and leave lot of useful costly tools and equipment behind  Sharing this tools and equipment with other affected caregivers can help economically specially the humble families with scarce resources not able to afford tools and equipment which most of the time are very costly- this motivates the caregiver and also helps keep hope for an easier way to deal with the situation.

 An online platform designed to reduce the caregiving workload.  www.laborforcare.com is designed for family caregivers and for entrepreneurs. It supports caregivers by connecting them to small businesses that will assist them with household chores and caregiving responsibilities. Please visit the beta website at www.laborforcare.com. It's 90% complete.  I would try website user-testing to test the functionality of the website. I would also seek recommendations for additional features.  I would like to know the percentage of people who would use a website such as Laborforcare.com to secure services and/or seek professional advice from the professionals on the page.  Over 1 year  An Individual  I'm currently an ESL teacher. In my free time I design and develop websites.  LaborForCare.com is a website where caregivers can identify- search and book services. Caregivers can identify what services they need to make their caregiving experience easier- search for a service provider that can help them- and book services! Service Providers create a profile describing services- and book clients. L4C connects people who need each other but can't find each other easily.  This people-to-people model for doing business is becoming increasingly popular because it puts commerce back into the hands of people. As time goes by- caregivers will be more technologically savvy and be accustomed to this model. There's no cost to use the platform for caregivers. It's a simple solution to an issue that can be challenging for people: finding the right help for caregiving needs. In a lifetime- this website will still be trendy and be able to incorporate emerging technologies.  The platform can accommodate many users from around the world. It can used by anyone with a computer- tablet or phone. Marketing is the primary tool needed for scalability. It's important that people are aware of LaborForCare's purpose and abilities. Other tools to consider are adding one or two team members to help with customer service- and incorporating multiple languages into the platform. I would also like to add service provider background checks into the platform.  The impact can be measured by evaluating 3 things.1 - The use of the platform. We can look at how many people are using the website for caregiving help and booking services. 2 - Evaluating the satisfaction of all users from booking the services to the actual service being provided. 3 - Look for improvement suggestions from consumers. When people want your platform to be better it shows they're interested in your success.  I need to work on procedural things such as creating a refund policy and creating a vetting process for service providers. I'm interested in looking at a questionnaire and maybe even a fee to register on the website. If people are willing to pay a fee to use the website it shows their interest and commitment. Once those are complete- I will integrate the payment system. ,0,1
 We provide care connectivity and visibility across people- devices- and data via our SaaScare platform and in-home device.  LifeAssist's Circura provide technology that empowers patients to connect and collaborate with family- health providers and support systems to encourage preventative health maintenance and aging-in-place scenarios. LifeAssist's solution engages family members- caregivers and the in-home care recipient through dynamic care circles that allow bi-directional communication- calendaring and data sharing.  We launched a clinical trial with Centre of Aging and Brain Health last month- currently we are expanding our efforts to improve and engage those seeking in-home care coordination and have extended a free Beta program: - BETA Update: Since launching in November we have 5 active families using Circura for their loved one's dementia + other chronic conditions or complex health issues that require a lot of communication- coordination & connectivity via our care platform and in-home device  Be part of our extended beta- utilize our solution and provide valued feedback- assist in driving new features and functions that empower care givers- socialization of ideas.

Over 1 year  An Individual  Have been engaged in healthcare for over eight years with initial focus on large enterprise transformation projects like radiation dose management- electronic health records- tele-health- etc.Very enthusiastic about smart health and how it connects and builds on the care continuity.  LifeAssist’s technology allows all family and relevant caregivers at any point in an individual’s care journey- to connect- communicate- share pertinent information and collaborate with all health providers- family and support systems to encourage health maintenance- and independent living. We connect the smart home...smart hospital...smart long-term care provider.  Digital healthcare is about real-time integration of devices- data and the people to provide the best engagement across the social- clinical- financial and physical requirements of the care recipient.At LifeAssist- we focus on patient-centered care by connecting all relevant caregivers to the recipient- regardless of location.We create Active Care Circles that are mobile- extensible and flexible. We have priced our solution at a cost that is less than most PERS (Personal Emergency Response)  LifeAssist's business model is B2B2C- our initial beta- clinical trial and existing clients are our touchstone:We focus our solution on the 83.7M seniors and their families seeking to maximize independence and aging in place.We focus on 6-500 Hospitals seeking to reduce avoidable readmissions.We focus on the Long-term care communities seeking greater engagement of their residents.Smart homes- smart hospitals- smart long-term care for greater health and wellness continuity.  Measurement would be based on the number of of active and dynamic care circles that LifeAssist's Circura supports. The more people involved and engaged the better. Also it would be measured by the amount of bi-directional communication- calendaring and data sharing that the care circles produced as care is provided.Lastly it is the collection- management and utilization of all relevant device and IoT data...and how it can be used of predictive and preventative health.  LifeAssist will focus on building out care circle features and functionality within our current client set.

 We want world where everyone can love later life- where we stand up and speak for all those who have reached later life- and to bring peace  Our idea stems from personal experiences with our elderly relatives.We can see first hand their fierce desire to continue living with as much independence as possible.We see areas where technology can give them the tools to live with peace of mind.This also extends to their network of family- friends and carers. We also understand dementia does not just affect the person with the disease.And we also know that it is not just the elderly who can be diagnosed with dementia.  With our services being close to completion we aim to have a variety of users from different backgrounds test and provide feedback.We aim to work closely with carers- family members and those diagnosed with dementia to trial the services.We will also be able to use these tests to make any amendments or enhancements which may be noted.  We would like to leverage the community and network so that we can get in touch with carers- family members and sufferers of dementia to gauge interest and collect feedback.We would also like to build connections with health services both private and public where we believe our services could change they way they provide care.We will also soon be able to provide access to our services for the community to test themselves.  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm  My partner and I both currently work for a large investment bank in technology and software.We have experience of software development and have a keen interest in technology.

 To find all caregivers who need help- and connect them with people of love and compassion in their community- who will help them.  Faith2Care is designed for caregivers who are overwhelmed and need help.Each caregiver family is unique and has different needs.F2C brings caring- compassionate people from their community into their home and asks How can I help you? The F2C website resources tool lists relevant government- business- nonprofit- and University links.And- through its online presence- and crowdsourcing- F2C raises 'awareness' about caregiver families. This also creates 'market' awareness and opportunities.  I am lining up my connections to a large non-denominational church in my area who have a community organizer group within their faith community.My plan is to meet with them- and because they are so big- find out who in their community are caregivers and run both groups through the website making the connectionsof those who don't know each other and having them follow the email and website instructions of how to make the first face to face meeting and assessment.Then we will revise.  I am reconsidering changing the name from Faith2care- to Community2care.I have been approached by some people who are not affiliated with a faith-based community and still want to participate.I currently have a way to do that on the website being built- but the name change would facilitate it even better.I am curious to everyone's insight and opinion on this.Thanks!  0-3 months  An Individual  I am a former counselor.I was also an entrepreneur as a residential real estate developer.I am currently a professional speaker and professional Alzheimer's and Caregiver advocate.  As a nonprofit- Faith2care is a free service that finds caregiver families who need help and connects them- with compassionate people in their community- who want to help them.We find both groups of people by using social media crowdsourcing.We also provide easy access to all the local- regional- and national resources available offered by businesses- nonprofits- and Universities.  Faith2care is fully accessible to all caregiver families.There is no cost or charge in any way to participate.Faith2care is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit and raises money through donations- gifts- and grants.The website offers at least four ways for individuals to donate or help fundraise. The largest financial support will come directly from related businesses and organizations who want greater visibility with participating caregivers by becoming sponsors or partners with Faith2care.  Because Faith2care is internet based- with a website and database as its platform and using social media and digital media and crowdsourcing as its outreach- there are no limits to its scalability other than minor language barriers.This time next year we plan to pursue operating in Canada- the UK- and Australia by adjusting the database- the matching mechanism- and pursuing the business connections.  The scope of the impact Faith2care can have on caregiver families- volunteers- businesses- organizations and research universities could be huge and beyond the room we have here to list.But to start we will be able to easily track the number of connections.The impact will be different for each family due to their needs and the resources of the volunteers to help them. But by creating a unique well-designed database and using surveys- we will identify the more common areas of impact.  Launching the almost built-out website is the next step.Then concurrently- launching the crowdsourcing aspects through social media and advertising campaigns- building the website deeper by continually adding more businesses and organizations to the resource area- and building relationships with sponsors and partners. ,0,1

 A mobile app connected to a smart bracelet uses machine learning to generate insights about changes that may affect their health  This idea is designed to help caregivers understand the progress of the disease. From the insights generated by the app- they can understand when older adults need an extra help. For example- from the data gathered- if the user isn't sleeping well and is skipping meals the app will generate an insight and alert the family that the user may be feeling depressed. These insights can also track the progress of the disease by reporting how frequently the user's routine changes.  I'd like to learn more about the technology requirements and opportunities. Which data should be collected in order to identify the progress of dementia and which insights can we generate from this data. I'd also like to learn what is the best way test this idea- how it should be tested in order to guarantee the success of this app.  4 months - 1 year  A group brainstorm  I have a background in graphic and motion graphic design.

 A digital conversation tool that informs- supports- and prepares unpaid caregivers of older adults with dementia or cognitive impairment.  It is designed for the overwhelmed & isolated caregivers of individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment. Caregivers are often overwhelmed searching online. Many can feel isolated- reluctant to ask for help- and unaware how many share their experience. Our tool provides information in a more approachable way: a private- automated conversation — a safespace to ask hard questions. It raises topics we put off & bridges caregiver out of isolation toward supportive community resources.  We tested earliest ideas using paper prototypes with caregivers at senior centers. Based on feedback- we iterated new designs and moved into testing new approaches to content and features. Our first digital service iteration was a functional chatbot on Facebook Messenger. We tested this version with caregivers as well as clinical advisors- social workers and support group coordinators. This influenced more changes that were tested in a Refinement Workshop hosted with the NYC OpenIDEO Chapter.  Based on user feedback & observation- we pivoted our content format & the technical implementation. We're focusing on more bite-sized conversations. Interaction will prioritize providing information over capturing background on the caregiver & care recipient. This requires options for more user driven customization (e.g. ability to skip portions of a topic that they're familiar). We'd love the OpenIDEO folks to check out www.hellocaregiver.org - test drive the tool & let us know your thoughts!  0-3 months  A group brainstorm  My background is in software product management and entrepreneurship with focus transitioning from Big Data and digital comms to social impact tech with direct end-user benefit. I was also a hands-on caregiver for my father as his Alzheimer's progressed. Our team includes a developer and designer.  A digital conversation tool for unpaid caregivers of people with cognitive impairment. It learns about the caregiver & care-recipient. It initiates topics- connecting caregivers with relevant- local services. It provides caregiving & self-care advice. Empowering caregivers with knowledge & support systems we're fighting caregiver burnout & isolation. Promoting caregiver & care-recipient wellbeing.  Hello Caregiver focuses on accessibility for users in terms of convenience- technology- information- and expense. It's designed for mobile because busy caregivers always have their phone on them. It offers quick- useful knowledge & suggested resources. To eliminate obstacles to access- especially for the large portion of low income caregivers- providing a free tool is a priority. We're seeking financial and development partnerships with clinical & social impact foundations serving this audience.  Hello Caregiver has a two prong strategy for scaling - expanding languages/cultures &expanding beyond our NY area pilots. We will leverage our partnerships with clinical and social services organizations. These organizations know the content- already support caregivers of many cultures- & have national affiliates. Moving into other cities & rural areas- the core features & most of the content will be re-usable. As we roll out in new regions- our library of local resources will be expanded.  As we're initially learning about users- our earliest measurements will focus on number of users and count of click-throughs to resources (both informational and activities offered by local organizations). As our prototype moves into pilots as a minimum viable product- we'll actively measure impact by assessing: * Increased Access to Care & Support Services* Improved Mental & Physical Health * Household Income Boost- and* Increased Legal & Medical Preparation  Based on recent user feedback- Hello Caregiver is pivoting from being based in Facebook Messenger to a web app that periodically pings registered users via SMS or Facebook Messenger. This will enable more convenient navigation- search options- a cleaner conversation format- and additional functionality such as events calendar- profiles- and shared user stories. Working with our clinical and social work partners- these updates will be tested with caregivers per the roadmap discussed in above. ,0,1
 When memory loss separates us- shift to imagination to rediscover joy- find meaning- and connect and repair relationships.  We provide tools and support for care partners to use creativity - shifting from an expectation of memory to the freedom of imagination - to engage their partner with dementia in joyful- playful- meaningful moments that can in turn contribute to community-building arts projects that change the way people think about dementia.  We have created multiple large-scale projects- and have had creative engagement software available to families for free since 2011. We are creating new tools (digital and print) that will expand features to go from individual creative prompts to meaningful projects that people can participate in from wherever they live. Families can respond by phone- by web- or by mail. With over 200 prompts currently on our site- designing and printing a new Creative Connection Kit is a key tangible step.  We are actively building our design team now for our new digital and physical tools. IDEO can bring us partnership/networking for spreading the word- feedback to concepts- particularly our desire to integrate playful- yet meaningful metrics.Funding- of course- is also enormously helpful.  Over 1 year  A group brainstorm  I am a Theatre PhD teaching arts and social entrepreneurship; an artist- researcher and innovator in creativity and aging. I am an Ashoka and MacArthur Fellow. I founded TimeSlips back in 1998- and we went non-profit in 2013.I've written loads of articles and 3 books on creativity and aging.  When dementia separates you from loved ones and friends- you can connect by learning to shift from the expectation of memory to the freedom of imagination. We will offer project ideas and tools for engagement that bring joy- meaning- purpose- and belonging to families with dementia. We use the arts to reknit families with dementia back into their communities and the world.  In its next iteration- our Creativity Center- with hundreds of prompts for meaningful engagement- will remain free to all users. We offer training and certification for professionals and care systems to support the costs of keeping the Creativity Center free to families. We will promote through partnership. We will also transform the stories- poems- and art submitted to our site into works of art that can be purchased or shared as part of exhibits/performances that fight the stigma of dementia.  With certified facilitators in 43 states and 14 counties- we already have a measure of scalability. With far-reaching partnerships to reach family caregivers- we aim to reach a tipping point where meaningful engagement is standard practice in both home and professional settings- and can follow a person with dementia across care settings.  We'll measure the quality and the quantity of engagement in our new online tools.When caregivers are using the Creativity Center- they will see a playful- pop-up survey with a smiley face scale to measure engagement and affect. How much joy was created in this session? For you? Your care partner? We'll also provide an option for users to invite others to the site- and to share stories of connection- and will measure QUANTITY by how many use the site and refer us to others.  We have raised funds and are in the midst of creating our new digital tools - our Creativity Center with embedded evaluation and our new Learning Center with new online training modules that specifically target families/friends; student volunteers; and staff. We are identifying designers and seeking funds to support the printing of the new Creative Connection Kit. ,0,1
