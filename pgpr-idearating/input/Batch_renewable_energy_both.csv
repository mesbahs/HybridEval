We've already seen how small towns in Germany can invest in renewables and be 100% energy independent while turning a profit. We've also seen how companies in the US can use leasing strategies to produce and install solar panels for no cost to the owner of the building and still turn a profit. Much like the creative leasing structure employed by companies such as SolarCity- the co-op would require members to pay a small monthly fee to participate. Much like the small towns in Germany- the profits would be shared among everyone in the co-op by distributing costs and re-investing to expand infrastructure to new members.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Homeowners who want to base their energy on renewables- regardless of where they live- would want to participate in the rooftop solar co-op. Already there are for-profit companies offering leasing programs that make it affordable for homeowners and profitable for the companies that lease the solar panels. What's missing is a solar co-op that can offer similar services while building a strong community of people that benefit. The goal is to allow homeowners to pool their resources and move everyone toward a renewable future. The rooftop solar co-op offers the opportunity for members to become their own utility company while lowering their rates and possibly turning a small profit -- all while transitioning away from reliance on energy produced from less sustainable- polluting sources such as coal.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By using an existing- proven business model and applying it to a non-profit- member-owned co-op- we can remove many of the barriers preventing homeowners from adopting rooftop solar for their homes. Traditional solar installations can be costly up front- even with subsidies. And installing the solar panels yourself means you are responsible for maintaining them. Solar leasing solves the problems of expensive installation and maintenance and replaces it with small monthly payments designed to be lower than your utility bill. Because solar leasing needs to be profitable- these companies will only install solar panels on homes with high utility bills and high rates.A co-op would remove profit-based financial motivations- and thus remove the financial limitations of rapidly expanding our solar infrastructure. Some co-op members will live in areas where their installation is more profitable than another. These more profitable installations can help subsidize installations in areas with lower profitability. In essence- everyone in the co-op will be able to subsidize and support each other. Because solar leasing companies are clearly able to be profitable- it is likely that a solar co-op would still be able to operate affordably even if the profitability requirement of a specific installation was relaxed to be more inclusive.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The idea of sharing the benefits of renewable energy has already been proven effective by municipalities around the world and by solar leasing companies here in the US. Looking at the deregulated energy market in Texas would provide another example of how people can pool their resources to affect change.In Texas you can buy your energy from a broker who sources your energy for you. Mostly the energy brokers are competing on price but some of them are offering to source a high percentage of your energy from renewable sources.

This idea builds on the simple idea of producing biodiesel with used cooking oil at the local level- in developing economies by removing a common barrier to setting up small biodiesel plants: training and technology acquisition needed to empower local production.

It helps vehicles run smoother and leads to engines lasting much longer. Further- owners won't be subject to the price volatility of fossil fuels. - Community members: Everyone in the community will enjoy the longterm health benefits that come with increasing renewable fuels in the area- less asthma- less polluted waters- less lung disease.

This idea is simple- biodiesel plants will become valuable environmental education centers for the community- which is just as important as their production capacity. By providing an alternate- clean fuel source- these plants can encourage a swift transition to renewable fuels from polluting ones for anyone that owns a vehicle or generator.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>At this point- I need to better understand the costs associated with setting up a small biodiesel plant- including the price of necessary machinery- and the steps needed to ship it to various regions around the world.

Power is essential for emergency response operations involving communications- fire and police stations- command and control centers- hospitals- water and sewer plants- water pumping- elevators- fuel pumps- medical equipment- refrigeration- heating- and for so many other types critical- electronic equipment. Solar plus energy storage for critical community facilities—fire- police- emergency shelters- as well as power protection for affordable and elderly housing facilities—is the technology innovation with the greatest potential to expand community-based renewable power to scale across the US in the years ahead.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>All members of a community can benefit from distributed- resilient power solutions like solar+storage located at critical facilities and community shelters. Other who could benefit are vulnerable populations including the disabled- elderly and the poor- if resilient power solutions are incorporated into their buildings and facilities. If these facilities remain “powered” during a long duration power outage- residents will not have to be moved- their ability to charge medical and mobility devices will remain- refrigeration and heating systems will be powered- and they could ride out the outage by sheltering in place. As communities start to prepare of the effects of climate change and energy assurance- the ability to deploy clean- reliable- renewable energy solutions should be at the top of the list. How and where solar+storage technologies can keep emergency management and response systems powered should be incorporated into new community planning discussions and resilience plans.In a blueprint for how a community could become more “power resilient-” Clean Energy Group produced a report- Clean Energy for Resilient Communities- which shows how the City of Baltimore and other cities could use clean energy to create a more reliable electric system that protects vulnerable citizens during power blackouts. The report is the first in-depth review of national policies and finance strategies to use solar and energy storage to provide more power protection in an urban setting. The report says that critical public facilities like hospitals- fire stations- gas stations- community shelters- and schools should use more resilient power technologies to protect people during power outages. The report also recommends new business models and highlights the emergence of companies that now sell solar with battery storage services to customers—to address the overlooked problem of stand-alone PV systems not working during power outages. See http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/2014-Files/Clean-Energy-for-Resilient-Communities-Report-Feb2014.pdf.In order for this transition to succeed- community leaders need more information about how these technologies will work and how they can finance them. Developers need to understand how to incorporate these technologies into their plans and how to communicate the benefits to communities. As communities- such as those in Massachusetts- start to deploy solar+storage technologies- Clean Energy Group needs to work find out what challenges they faced- how they overcame those challenges- and then provide these lessons-learned to other communities who are moving in the same direction.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Installations of solar+storage technologies can accelerate renewable energy markets. If more communities install solar+storage technologies in place of diesel generators- more resilient- clean and reliable power will be provided during power outages. If these systems are sized to provide power to larger loads all of the time- communities will decrease their reliance on fossil fuels and drive the market demand for solar and storage technologies. This increased demand should result in lower costs as these markets achieve scale. The more renewable energy technologies are deployed- the greater our ability to meet the challenges of climate change. As a society- the move the domestic- distributed energy production in renewable energy will also have economic- health- and other societal benefits at the local and national level. What many people who install gird-connected solar PV equipment on their homes fail to realize is that in most cases- if the grid goes down- there solar panels can no longer supply electricity to their homes. With solar+storage systems- additional equipment is deployed that would allow the home to disconnect from the grid during a power outage and continue to generate power that the homeowner can use. The same goes for business and other facilities. Adding storage to a system moves the solar equipment to a new level – with the ability to provide power during an outage.With steadily dropping costs in both solar and energy storage technologies- solar+storage has become a viable and more reliable choice for emergency power. Not only do solar+storage systems have the ability to provide power indefinitely when the grid is unavailable- they can also cut costs and generate revenue during the 99.9% of the time when the grid is functioning normally. In many cases- these savings and revenue streams can drastically reduce the payback period of an energy storage system. These technologies can provide clean energy- possible revenues- and more energy security to communities. As part of the Resilient Power Project- Clean Energy Group has created a small technical assistance fund to help communities analyze these options as part of our Resilient Power Project- with funding from several foundations. But the demand is great to work with more communities across the country. In addition- to get to scale- new forms of financing mechanisms are needed to aggregate projects and bring in lower cost capital to reduce project costs for communities. Our Resilient Power Project is addressing the challenges to widespread deployment of these technologies. We have recently published a report- “Financing for Resilient Power Solutions” that can be downloaded at http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/CEG-Financing-for-Resilient-Power.pdf. Solar+storage is a hybrid innovation that benefits customers directly- so it is not dependent solely on the environmental attributes of the technology- but rather follows the “disruptive technology” path of cheaper- smaller and more effective technologies that will upset the established grid status quo more rapidly than a pure subsidy based model.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Clean Energy Group is working with leading community developers to install these technologies now in affordable housing communities across the country.

Power is essential for emergency response operations involving communications- fire and police stations- command and control centers- hospitals- water and sewer plants- water pumping- elevators- fuel pumps- medical equipment- refrigeration- heating- and for so many other types critical- electronic equipment. Solar plus energy storage for critical community facilities—fire- police- emergency shelters- as well as power protection for affordable and elderly housing facilities—is the technology innovation with the greatest potential to expand community-based renewable power to scale across the US in the years ahead.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>All members of a community can benefit from distributed- resilient power solutions like solar+storage located at critical facilities and community shelters. Other who could benefit are vulnerable populations including the disabled- elderly and the poor- if resilient power solutions are incorporated into their buildings and facilities. If these facilities remain “powered” during a long duration power outage- residents will not have to be moved- their ability to charge medical and mobility devices will remain- refrigeration and heating systems will be powered- and they could ride out the outage by sheltering in place. As communities start to prepare of the effects of climate change and energy assurance- the ability to deploy clean- reliable- renewable energy solutions should be at the top of the list. How and where solar+storage technologies can keep emergency management and response systems powered should be incorporated into new community planning discussions and resilience plans.In a blueprint for how a community could become more “power resilient-” Clean Energy Group produced a report- Clean Energy for Resilient Communities- which shows how the City of Baltimore and other cities could use clean energy to create a more reliable electric system that protects vulnerable citizens during power blackouts. The report is the first in-depth review of national policies and finance strategies to use solar and energy storage to provide more power protection in an urban setting. The report says that critical public facilities like hospitals- fire stations- gas stations- community shelters- and schools should use more resilient power technologies to protect people during power outages. The report also recommends new business models and highlights the emergence of companies that now sell solar with battery storage services to customers—to address the overlooked problem of stand-alone PV systems not working during power outages. See http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/2014-Files/Clean-Energy-for-Resilient-Communities-Report-Feb2014.pdf.In order for this transition to succeed- community leaders need more information about how these technologies will work and how they can finance them. Developers need to understand how to incorporate these technologies into their plans and how to communicate the benefits to communities. As communities- such as those in Massachusetts- start to deploy solar+storage technologies- Clean Energy Group needs to work find out what challenges they faced- how they overcame those challenges- and then provide these lessons-learned to other communities who are moving in the same direction.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Installations of solar+storage technologies can accelerate renewable energy markets. If more communities install solar+storage technologies in place of diesel generators- more resilient- clean and reliable power will be provided during power outages. If these systems are sized to provide power to larger loads all of the time- communities will decrease their reliance on fossil fuels and drive the market demand for solar and storage technologies. This increased demand should result in lower costs as these markets achieve scale. The more renewable energy technologies are deployed- the greater our ability to meet the challenges of climate change. As a society- the move the domestic- distributed energy production in renewable energy will also have economic- health- and other societal benefits at the local and national level. What many people who install gird-connected solar PV equipment on their homes fail to realize is that in most cases- if the grid goes down- there solar panels can no longer supply electricity to their homes. With solar+storage systems- additional equipment is deployed that would allow the home to disconnect from the grid during a power outage and continue to generate power that the homeowner can use. The same goes for business and other facilities. Adding storage to a system moves the solar equipment to a new level – with the ability to provide power during an outage.With steadily dropping costs in both solar and energy storage technologies- solar+storage has become a viable and more reliable choice for emergency power. Not only do solar+storage systems have the ability to provide power indefinitely when the grid is unavailable- they can also cut costs and generate revenue during the 99.9% of the time when the grid is functioning normally. In many cases- these savings and revenue streams can drastically reduce the payback period of an energy storage system. These technologies can provide clean energy- possible revenues- and more energy security to communities.

We transfer technology and build capacity by establishing local partnerships that manufacture- own and operate novel distributed renewable energy infrastructure to provide an affordable distributed utility service to rural areas. There are many companies that offer energy products to off-grid communities but we represent something different: a micro-utility- a full scale replacement for a 24/7 reliable electrical grid- specifically for areas that the conventional grid may never reach.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The lack of electricity infrastructure is especially apparent in rural communities. According to estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA)- only 14% of people living in rural Africa have access to electricity. This crucial infrastructure is needed by private households and it is essential as a multiplier for the effectiveness of institutions such as schools and health clinics that can otherwise only offer a bare minimum of services to their communities. Especially in regard to health institutions- the need for electricity is well understood: specialized medical diagnostic and treatment equipment (x-ray machines- blood analyzers- etc.)- computers- Electronic Medical Recordkeeping (EMR)- and telemedicine programs all depend on electricity. Supporting loads such as lighting (for increased hours of operation and security)- storage of medicines and vaccines- and the powering of staff quarters (which has implications for the attraction and retention of qualified professionals to work in remote areas)- are also basic requirements for effective health care.In addition to electricity- thermal energy plays a vital role for operations and hygiene in the form of cooling or heating the clinic facility and the providing of hot water – an aspect often overlooked in electrification programs. Common sense indicates that clinics and schools cannot operate effectively if the temperature rises above 90°F or drops below 50 °F- but little is currently done to systematically manage climate extremes when planning infrastructure upgrades.Based on published data- STG estimates that there are 80-000 health clinics and 260-000 schools worldwide that currently operate without electricity. The total value of this market is US $4.5B. To put the global market size in context- in Africa alone the market for diesel generators has been consistently growing at 30% per annum since 2006 and exceeded US $1 billion in 2007. This figure of course belies the real cost of diesel power generation- since the annual cost of fuel consumed by the installed base of generators is an order of magnitude greater than the annual capital investment- with estimates ranging between US$10-50 billion.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Most off-grid communities in developing countries are dependent on kerosene lamps for lighting as well as batteries and diesel generators for powering basic appliances. The lack of proper access to energy sources forces communities to pay very high prices for electricity use despite the fact that most of these villages lie in areas with ideal resources for implementing affordable solar energy systems. STG’s approach is to help communities to bridge the gap between the feasibility of using renewable energy systems and the high capital cost that prevents their implementation with specialized off-grid technology and an innovative partnership model.Additionally- one of our core beliefs is that sustainability can only be secured in the long-term if the communities actively participate in the electrification process. Next to technology transfer and training of local employees- it is of great importance to us to not deliver our energy systems as a black box- but to invite members of the community to learn about the technology and to incorporate their suggestions into our design process at an early stage.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>STG International was founded on the basis of our experiences as volunteers in Lesotho- Africa. Throughout our work- we were able to gain extensive knowledge of the needs of underserved communities and therefore identified the lack of access to electricity as one of the main obstacles that stands in the way of delivering adequate education and healthcare as well as the building of infrastructure needed for economic development. After founding STG and designing our technology- we installed our first energy system at Matjoto health clinic in Lesotho. Over the course of this process- we established a local subsidiary- STG Lesotho- with several full-time employees- and cooperated with the Lesotho government to offer training and educational courses to students and the local population. The first installation of our energy system enabled us to gain valuable experiences on how to optimize our business plan and our technology. Based on these experiences- we feel confident to move to the next step and install our first- village-scale pilot systems to test and further advance our approach and our energy systems.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One of the main reasons why we would like to become a member of OpenIDEO is its focus on community.

The company’s technology will provide energy developers and utilities with a solution for storing up to giga-watt hours of electricity at a cost point unachievable in the current marketplace. An early injection of philanthropic capital will allow Quidnet to complete its pilot project in West Texas and solicit follow-on investment from the private markets.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>There are two distinct ways in which an early investment in Quidnet would benefit our communities in the US and abroad: 1) directly through the charitable impacts of Quidnet's core business and 2) indirectly as a proof-of-concept for PRIME.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Due to the intermittency issues associated with solar and wind electricity generation- energy storage is vital to deployment of renewables in any community.Unfortunately- the capital cost of the batteries included in a residential off-grid solar plus batteries system currently cost about $500 per kWh. However- to achieve cost parity with the grid- the capital cost of batteries would need to decline to about $20 per kWh.Absent a major technological breakthrough- battery costs are likely to remain above $20 per kWh for several decades. In 2012- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that battery costs would fall as low as $135 per kWh by 2035 in the best case scenario.Quidnet's unconventional solution could help us reach these goals much sooner and help communities all over the world transition to renewables without ongoing government or philanthropic subsidies.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Quidnet is testing its concept by using a spent oil well in West Texas as a pilot project. It is taking assets that sit idle -- spent oil and gas wells -- and turning them into a force for good.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","1","","Im an not sure what this idea proposes.

A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community. I would love to learn more about this kind of social dynamic.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","3","It needs more incentive for the consumer.","It is already been done.

The idea of partnership for ideas renewable energy will help everyone in the community of Tanzania. it encourages young people from secondary schools and Civil Society Organizations to use the equipments and practical technical assistance for access to renewable energy. It will helps companies to promote their sustainable business- and tackles the challenges of competition of the markets and infrastructures and give back to their communities.The idea is targets to meet with young people aged 20-35 from secondary school- high schools of Tanzania as we learned that young people are lifted behinds in creating innovations.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea of Partnership for Renewable Energy targets to create collaborative platform and provide incentive of equipment among key players that lead to innovations solutions in Tanzania- will refine the community rapidly transition in Tanzania by Increase and scale up the network of key players that lead to innovation solutions in Tanzania- and it will be a reliable method for investors and companies to invest a renewable energy through new designers of innovation in Tanzanian.By the end of 2019 participants will be the creator of renewable energy and known in their communities- Participants will be able to mobilize and encourage companies and investors to invest renewable energy in their communities- also will be able to create strategies plans for improve renewable energy in organizations or their own activities.In general participants will be enabled to get motivated and played well in creative- and there is a cooperation of thoughts on renewable energy- and there is a reliable investment of energy in Tanzania.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Since the idea of Partnership for Ideas Renewable Energy is in the under process of being implemented.

Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program.

We raise money through crowdfunding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations and worker-owned cooperatives.As these organizations pay us back- we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.It's a pay-it-forward model for community solar.We call it the Solar Seed Fund.Learn more at www.solarseedfund.org and www.re-volv.org!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The Solar Seed Fund benefits everyone by helping nonprofits and cooperatives that serve their community go solar. The avoided carbon emissions help alleviate climate change- and seeing solar panels on the rooftops of beloved community organizations inspires community members to go solar at home. But even if someone can't go solar at home- they can chip in and support the Solar Seed Fund and know that they are actively creating climate solutions. Every dollar donated is a vote for a clean energy future.Small community-based nonprofits and cooperatives often want to go solar to save money and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. However- due to their tax structure- credit rating- and the size of their projects- they often can’t find solar financing.RE-volv makes going solar easier for these organizations by offering low-cost financing through hassle-free lease agreements. In addition- through RE-volv's educational outreach programs- these community organizations are helping to raise awareness about solar energy among the people they serve.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>RE-volv’s main objective is to implement renewable energy projects in communities that can’t afford them. Nonprofits and cooperatives that serve as the backbone of our communities are often left without financing options for solar energy. Through its revolving fund model- RE-volv is able to provide access to solar to those who previously didn’t have it.RE-volv’s programs are uniquely designed to increase civic participation. Traditional solar financing comes from a few big banks and financial institutions. RE-volv turns this model on its head.RE-volv gives every single person the ability to help support building local solar projects. This way- each person can take action on climate change and participate in creating a more sustainable community.Through this community participatory finance model- RE-volv creates localized- renewable power generation and green jobs through its solar installations.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>So far- we've crowdfunded two projects successfully and are currently in the middle of our third crowdfunding campaign. You can check it out at www.solarseedfund.org! Lease payments from the first two projects have lowered the amount we need to crowdfund for our current project by $7-008. Soon we will launch our own crowdfunding platform giving donors the ability to view a portfolio of the projects they’ve supported and the environmental impact they’ve had. With the new platform we’ll be experimenting with functionality to find out what are the key features to foster engagement on the site.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We need to expand the Solar Seed Fund network and take our model to scale. We're going to be launching our own crowdfunding platform soon and we want to know from you- the community- how we can make this an interactive and empowering way for people to support clean energy.

Working on a roster all signed up members do the whole communities errands in one go- rather than everyone doing their own.This gives a two short/medium term objectives and one longer term objective: 1) Cut down emissions of burnt fossil fuels2) Everyone signed up contributes the money they have saved on petrol or Diesel into the long term gain pot3) The long term gain pot will be used to purchase an Electric vehicle for the errand run for the future.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Mostly communities that use private transport for all errand runs- therefore a fairly wide demographic. The idea would likely have higher benefit for communities that have more disparate resources- therefore longer journeys for errands.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Short term gains- mean that less fossil fuel is used in everyday life- longer term gains greatly improve that with the introduction of EVs (Electric Vehicles). Exposure to using an EV in this way may also encourage users to be more inclined to replace their own fossil fuel vehicles with a capable EV.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>To understand how this might fly would be to get some understanding of the interest locally of environmental concerns and how many members of the community would be interested in participating in the scheme.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Input of validity in people's time and mileage spent on errand runs that could be added to a community roster would start to flesh out the amount of mileage/money that could be saved in a sizeable community and therefore some ideas could be formed around time to purchase for the EV.

We identify- train and support women as entrepreneurs to sell portable solar PV lighting and mobile charging solutions to their last mile customers in Nepal.The widespread use of cell-phones in developing countries willenable us to reach distant markets and electrify one third of the world's population living in energy poverty.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Nepal’s entire population is under electrified- with 60% percent not even connected to the unreliable electric grid. Empower Generation serves rural households that typically spend around 10% of their income on harmful and ineffective lighting- like kerosene lanterns. Rural women bear the brunt of energy poverty in Nepal- as they are responsible for obtaining basic fuels and providing energy services to the family. With limited or no career options- women are often confined to these traditional tasks. Empower Generation offers women life-changing careers providing vital energy services to local communities. Empower Generation is a lean- global team that works with local stakeholders to catalyze energy access. Our local women-entrepreneurs are the main players. We also work closely with local community organizations and financial institutions- mobile money service providers- and solar power system designers and manufacturers.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Solar power is available- affordable and reliable – the obstacles lie in financing and distribution for under-electrified rural communities. Our model empowers local women to become a part of our solar distribution franchise and sustainably deliver power to the last mile. With the convenience of mobile payments paired with mobile-controlled systems- EG entrepreneurs can offer customers high-quality- efficient solar power systems for their homes in exchange for monthly payments. With mobile money- entrepreneurs and agents will be able to collect monthly payments easily even when customers are hard-to-reach.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are ready to pilot our PAYG solar-home-system and mobile payment platform within our existing distribution network of 7 women-led solar businesses and expand it to our 2015 class of 10 entrepreneurs later this year. With an expanded customer base- more enterprises and a mobile marketing campaign EG will be able to build on our existing model of women-led distributed energy services to offer more customers more power and appliances with built-in financing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>•Mobile money + telecommunications partners/advisors•App/backend software developers/advisors•Consumer electronics specialists to help us integrate PAYG technology- solar power components and appliances into a compelling package •PAYG technology sourcing partners•Training programs for solar installation/maintenance partners/advisors •Customer Financing/Impact investment/Program-Related-Investment</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","4","It can create a movement.","Why are the women called entrepreneurs?

In today’s world of mobile technology and rechargeable batteries- people don’t necessarily need electricity delivered to their home - they need a battery charged. By providing lockers at a station- members of the community can drop off their device (or battery) for charging- and feel confident that their property will be secure and charged reliably. A simple- modular- central charging station- simplifies logistics and maintenance and lowers the cost of delivering renewable energy.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea benefits people and communities in the developing world that do not have reliable access to electricity. Most of whom have cell phones. One quarter of the world’s population is still without electricity- yet according to a recent U.N. report- 6 billion out of 7 billion people on earth have mobile phones. Cell phones can greatly improve quality of life in a rural village by providing access to medical care and financial services- improving community safety- and enabling local business and commerce.Each station or network of stations will need to be operated by a local organization or individual.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>These stations provide an alternative to running diesel generators to charge batteries- and will reduce pressure to extend the grid from centralized fossil fuel plants. Just as the developing world leapfrogged land-based telephone lines to mobile technology- so too will it leap over the model of a centralized power grid for delivering electricity. As the developed world is looking to smart grids- micro-grids and energy storage to increase resiliency of the power grid and enable greater penetration of renewable energy- this same technology will be leveraged to more quickly and affordably electrify rural developing markets. Our stations will help pave the way for larger renewable power stations- that will likely be based on similar technology and concept- to provide a wider range of services to heavier loads- perhaps even electric vehicles- or to power loads in homes and community centers.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>WrightGrid is currently deploying our stations at schools and Universities across the US- as well as taking them to outdoor music festivals and other outdoor events to engage the public- develop our technology and better understand how people interface with the stations and what the expectations are. The response to our charging stations has been overwhelmingly positive thus far in the domestic market. People need and want continual use of their cell phone and are less concerned with how this is enabled. So the real value of energy is the service it provides to the end user.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love to hear insights from the folks at Ideo.org and others with experience working in the developing world about the best ways to deploy our station and build a local presence. I’m sure there are conditions ‘on the ground’ that we haven’t anticipated that will influence our design and business strategy. We are hoping to connect with folks who can work with us to design the human interface to be more intuitive and accessible for people who speak other languages or cannot read. We would love to hear ideas about the possibilities of connecting our stations with mobile applications and services. We need to identify strong partners and we also need to continue to work on developing models for funding the stations and generating revenues.There are many other considerations- design options- ideas- statistics and data we can share to help facilitate the conversation- but had to omit for the sake of brevity.

How about Tesla and SolarCity? With companies getting more open up and passionate about introducing their new renewable technology to the public- it is not hard at all to have tours at companies with renewable energy highlights.Inspired by the NewCo event in the Bay Area- this ideais about organizing a NewEco Tour event- during which people can sign up for interesting companies' presentations and tours for free-have the flexibility to set their own schedule- and get valuable education about renewable energy and sustainable living.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>It will especially benefit communities who have renewable energy companies nearby.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>People will get more educated about renewable energy and feel more ready to start using it.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Whatever idea you have- feel free to share! It will be great too if you can:1) name a few renewable technology companies in your community.And do you think these companies would like to give tours according to your perception of their public image? 2) tell us if you are interested in going- and what type of business/technology interest you the most.3) give your advice on how to efficiently organize the tours.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","3","This is a small scale. it reaches only a few people. And those people are most likely already enthousiastic about sustainability.","People who are interested in this subject, love a tour.","A tour is feasible as long as it doesnt disrupt the workflow.","3","2","2"

[UPDATED 7 Feb - video]</h2><p>Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount. Every time the pasteurize using our cow-poop powered system- they prevent methane emissions and make more money.Industrial milk producers - Most milk is processed at large processing plants which are huge energy hogs. We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine. Save calves through affordable milk pasteurization.Others - We are also looking at raw milk- home cheesemakers- and others.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By embedding renewables within the dairy system- we change the renewables challenge and value proposition by making it one component of an income-generating product. Users can produce more electricity than they need- so they can also retail electricity to neighbors and others.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have talked to farmers in Costa Rica- China- and the US and we think there is a real need for our product. We do not yet have FDA approval for our new technology and one question we are trying to answer is if people in under-regulated markets will accept our technology (eg. small rural farmers in emerging economies- aged cheesemakers- raw milk drinkers- others) before we go through this long process. For the US- we are testing this now. We need to ask the same of people in emerging markets.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Help us design a product that fits into the way that people make milk and manage manure now.Also- help us get perspective on our ideas about emerging market opportunities- spoilage- and on-farm milk pasteurization. Though we are close to markets in California- we don't have as much perspective on emerging markets.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Biofuels</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Student Collaboration</p>","5","It is not clear to me how much this technology will cost the farmers. In the long run however I see clear benefits and the potential for a viable business model.","This sounds like a real problem for farmers that they would like to have solved.","It sounds like the technology is already here, it just needs to be approved and applied","4","4","3"
