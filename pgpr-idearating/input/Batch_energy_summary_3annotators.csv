It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.

Maybe Graphene? ). But there are MANY other examples. Window glasses that change their optical properties depending on the temperature- so to be extremely energy efficient.Conductive Inks that can just be printed- saving millions of chips waste.Adaptable airplane wings (profiting from Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) properties) that would mimic birds flight to be totally aerodinamic.And the list continues.So my idea is also focusing in the way materials themselves can contribute to the better profit of energy.

(Think of them as sort of like R2-D2s- but different.) These units could be mass produced- & purchased & installed in backyards & on building tops everywhere. Their solar cells would go up vertically- not horizontally- and work all day long--if designed to follow the sun--to produce a small-but-significant percentage of the electricity needs of- especially- households. Since they could be purchased & installed at relatively small cost- additional units could be purchased--or rented--& installed almost without limit- until- theoretically- allhousehold--& EV automobile--electricity needs are met. Heights would vary.  I would like to be included in the think tank for developing the idea- as I have certain designs in mind and just love the idea- but I am not concerned with idea proprietorship or other personal gain..  This idea benefits citizens everywhere- in an immediate- financial sense; but also it would benefit citizens everywhere in that it would greatly reduce the burning of coal and other fossil fuels for electrical power.. </p>","4","It all depends on the price of the units","You take control of your energy needs","It seems feasible, but I need to know the price of the units","3","4","3"
