However- there is as yet little understanding or trust in biogas as an energy source. This idea inspired communities to use biogas by providing a live and trusted demonstration of how it works. Harnessing children's natural 'pester power' and funding a pilot community will spread the power of poo to Kyrgyzstan's rural poor and enable them to lead their country's renewables transition.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This benefits rural poor communities with livestock in Kyrgyzstan- one of DFID’s 28 priority countries. These communities live predominantly off their farming practices and have little or no access to energy. Kyrgyzstan has a high rate of literacy and we would expect the education of the target communities to be basic but with reading and writing competency. Rather than specify locations at this stage- it would be preferable to work with already established local NGOs to ensure the right pilot community is chosen- and help to build bridges to other communities.Specifically targeting the poorest families and women to become the community-employed plant maintenance operatives would help to address the additional needs of these groupings.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>These communities do not currently use renewable energy sources as uptake in Kyrgyzstan of biogas has been very limited- despite its perfect positioning for this fuel type due to its combination of livestock and an energy crisis. This is largely due to prohibitive costs and lack of understanding in communities which this idea seeks to overcome. By using the positive influencing of children and broadening this out to the whole grouping- the pilot community will recognise livestock excrement as a source of power and a solution to their energy needs.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Running a workshop with children- and a second with children and parents- to test educational methods and the power of infant influencing- will help to understand the best methods of approaching this educational phase and ascertain what branding territories might be most applicable.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Further thoughts on innovative financing mechanisms appropriate to impoverished communitiesMoney to provide the initial loan to the pilot community</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Biofuels</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","3","It depends on a lot of circumstances.","It would depend on what the thoughts and feelings are of the people in the area.","If people aren't interested, they aren't going to want to take part.","3","3","3"

There's no doubt about that. Their favorite part of school is recess and they can't wait to get outside. What if we could use all of this energy to power places in our community- including our schools?Tiger Energy Biscuits- a Kraft company-used this same idea to build a playground. They partnered with a local university in the Philippines- working one year to create a playground that could capture energy used on the equipment to power their local community. This can be even more advanced- using other technology such as energy capturing tiles currently used at stadiums. This is a learning opportunity for kids and become cost effective for communities- and promote a school or business in the process.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The community: The cool thing about this is that it can be placed into any community.A community could plant a park- transform a park- add it to their schools- implement this into malls- theme-parks- anything! Once a community invests the time into making one- the parts and playground can be easily re-created for another location or purpose. If a city just wanted one swing set- they could just start out with that. With the money they save- they could grow their playground and their investment into even more opportunities for reusable energy.The people: Being a college student- I'm always looking for opportunities for projects like this to use my talents and make an impact- and I know I'm not the only one. Schools will want to be a part of this if it gives exposure to their university- and the opportunity for students to have a real-life experience. The kids: When I was a kid- we used to convince my teacher to give us extra recess. I know in second grade I would have so many questions of how the playground worked and why we were doing it. This could even be a fun way for schools and students to compete. They could see which class created the most energy- competing against their friends or even schools competing against schools.The city: This could create so much publicity for the city and others involved- going green is always a trend- and this is a cool way to promote it.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This idea isn't just about changing light-bulbs. This is about creating sustainable playgrounds that can power a city for years and years.Renewable energy- our focus is trying to change and develop things that already exist such as the oil industry- when we should be looking to completely new ideas (like Open IDEO is doing). If people want to have an impact on their planet- instead of waiting on someone else to change their energy- a community can start this on their own. They don't need to wait for a big company or organization- they can start making environmental change on their own!</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>1. Classes can start the discussion of energy- and start to brainstorm their own ideas and concepts for creating this renewable playground. This is the most cost effective and easiest way to see the potential of this project.2. Communities can host an even- putting things such as sustainable dance floors can be put in place to see how much energy a group of people can actually create! Their interest might start the discussion of putting this in place.http://www.sustainabledanceclub.com/products/sustainable_dance_floor/3.

We are also in conversation with a architecture firm that is working on sustainable work force housing for a number of projects throughout North America.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The folks at AVAVA Systems love meeting anyone who is passionate about affordable- sustainable housing. With that said- we are especially interested meeting people are working on real development projects and are open to innovative methods. We are also currently in fund raising mode- so if you or someone you know is interested in investing in “the most compelling way to build our communities” we would love to talk to them. Finally- we are always interested in talking to mechanical engineers and industrial designers.(UPDATE) One of the best things about contributing to this challenge has been the talented people that have come forward to offer their time and expertise to help us be more successful. 1. Thank you so much to Matthew Chow from the IDEO team for the help he gave us regarding our business strategy. Matthew started with a great template to evaluate our product applications. He then helped us figure out a clear and concise business plan around that application including potential partnerships- value proposition and growth strategy. Matthew's energy was inspiring and he asked some really good questions. We really appreciate the time and effort he devoted to our company.2. We have been contacted by mechanical engineer who shares our vision for creating affordable- sustainable and sexy housing solutions. We look forward to collaborating with her. We have also been contacted by a designer who is focusing on better utilizingpublic and vacant spaces- and we hope to provide him with some innovative solutions.

It is a city that will be completely free from any form of fossil fuel for its power usage thereby making it a renewable energy powered city. The appealing nature of the project will create a huge demand for more of this city projects in more locations inAfrica and even the world at large.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Smart City Africa Project is beneficial to African residents and visitors from all works of life- all ages- and the location choice will focus on rural areas which are abundant in unused land areas thereby depopulating the popular cities and building new and smart cities from the revenues and products of the Pioneer smart city.Because of the comprehensive nature of the city- It will impact lives in so many waysthereby creating a smart living culture among residents of the smart city.I see a sustainable future and a city like this would be a big step to creating that sustainable future-so far I have thought of several ways to create this future- well I came up with an Idea . since it takes a huge fund to make this project a reality- I thought of drawing up a 3D design of this plan and marketing it like an off plan project which will come with a price as well as incentives. Although my target might not be the low class population but I thought of the idea of selling citizenship's to this city with a starting price of $5000 individuals to $20000 for families and at this price citizens can benefit from free health care- a housing unit and security as well as business opportunities in the city. this can be achieved because Africans yearn to live in a better environment and for that price the middle class can really benefit from this- and since the first phase of this city is to set up energy efficient production lines which would be used in construction of the city- the low class can also benefit by having massive job creations.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>As a Smart City Project- powered by renewable energy- also a production hub for manufacturing of energy efficient products- which will be used to build more smart cities across Africa- the transition will be an unconscious and automatic one. As the demand for more smart cities will increase- especially due to the affordability of energy efficient living. I would like to add some further Statistics- the most populated city in Africa Lagos is approximately 1000km2 with a population of about 20 million people and the reason for the huge population because of the amount of production going on in the city. so if a new and smart city with 3 times the land mass and over 500 energy efficient production lines and over 1000 services and small companies and businesses- there will be a huge significance in the major cities depopulation as citizens will begin to seek employment in the new city and the Smart City Africa project is looking to be home to 5 million citizens.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>A plan is all it takes. if a plan of this city is designed and awareness is being created for the Smart City Africa Project- it will attract governments- investors- banks- communities- individuals and many more fund sources to partake in the project. choosing a location for a pioneer smart city in Africa- Nigeria by population is the largest populated country in Africa with major cities like Lagos- Abuja and Port Harcourt. But the smart city best location would be the less populated locations that are close to the major cities such as Imo state- Akwa Ibom state- Cross river state etc..</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The skills required for the Smart City Africa Project idea are as many as one can imagine Architects/ designers-Engineers-Technology experts-Accountants-urban city planners-renewable energy experts- and many more experts.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","5","Once started up, I think it could be sustained easily.","The idea itself is a good one and I think a lot of countries should look into this.","It seems like it would take a lot of work to pull this off.","2","4","4"

It is an income-producing asset for an entrepreneur (just like a chicken or goat) but it is also an affordable way to buy light (and mobile phone charging) for an end-consumer. The kit consists of 2 “hockey puck” rechargeable lights/phone chargers and 1 solar panel as well as instructional information and marketing materials. We call it the “hockey puck” because it looks like a hockey puck (we’re Canadian) and contains a rechargeable battery- LED- USB phone charger. We will sell this kit to entrepreneurs who then earn income from selling recharges and an end-user now has access to clean- affordable light and energy. It's a win win.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Social: Lack of light at night restricts children’s study hours. Toxic fumes cause death. KARIBU offers children the opportunity to study at night- the family to charge their mobile phone- and eliminates toxic kerosene fumes.Environmental: The use of kerosene emits millions of tons of CO2 / year and every KARIBU solar lamp sold reduces CO2 emissions by an estimated 100kg / year.Economic: Families waste 90+ USD every year on fuel and lack of light restricts local entrepreneurs. KARIBU saves money and increases working hours for small businesses.With KARIBU- families can afford solar lighting/mobile phone charging with the benefits above. For small shops- they now have a profitable business and no longer spend money on kerosene – sunshine is free. Furthermore- money stays in the community (that formerly went to buy kerosene) and it spurs local economic development.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Solar in Africa comes with a significant up ­front cost- which is not affordable for rural populations (and it's hard to get it to them). Our approach aligns the cash flow for solar lighting and mobile phone charging with that of kerosene–making it affordable. We leverage the existing sales channel for end­-users like Alice (the small shop network) and sell them a “businesses in a box” which allows them to become profitable in a few months.In contrast to the traditional manufacturer → retailer → customer model- KARIBU provides a continuous income stream (and more jobs) for entrepreneurs vs. a one-­off sale. This approach is very conducive to rural communities that are far from towns or the electric grid and that have no mobile network reception (and it doesn't have to be constructed/nailed to a roof). Given the relatively low up ­front cost for small shops- and short payback period- the model is very scalable.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are in the early stages of launching these new kits. We ran a small pilot project in Moshi- Kilimanjaro with great success.

Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community. We also would love to have volunteers as part of our planning or outreach teams. We welcome donations to help underwrite the cost of solutions that we are working to deploy.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","5","Once you get it going, I think there is no stopping this idea from being a success.","This would definitely work in certain areas.

Everybody cooks- everybody fries. And so everybody has leftover used cooking oil and in many cases does not know what to do with it. Only ahandful of countries have a working used kitchen oil collection program and the awareness is still very low. In third world countries and developing countries- often such oil isn't disposed properly because there are simply no means of doing so. By implementing a collection system in such countries- we not only protect the environment a little more- we also help to produce biofuels that can be reused over and over again as it is done in the UK for example.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This program would target local communities of Latin American countries where there is no working used oil collection system. Even if there is two restaurants that somehow recycle their used oil or dispose it relatively safely- the remaining fifty will pour the oil down the drain- which will clog the pipes of the entire building- street- neighborhood- city... Except for the local communities- this will be an initiative for those who are interested in using biofuels in order to either protect the environment- be more cost effective- or both.Strongly suggested would be to target children from elementary school- through high school to university by directly involving them in the program. Why? Simply because the future starts with the children. Educating them about biofuels will ensure their eco-responsibility standards to be higher. And how would this be done? The youngest ones could simply collect used cooking oil from their mom's kitchen and bring it to school that will then hand it over to the collection site. In the case of older children/teenagers- they could participate in the site collection directly as an extra curriculum activity.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Used cooking oil is a very fast way to obtain biofuels.

Consumers- financiers- and technical providers will be able to directly connect through our online social marketplace: closing the access gap to renewable energy. Whether the consumer is an individual- a school- or neighborhood- they can find the resources and options they need: banks to finance a program- a government grant for their project- or the technical experts to make it happen.Local options will be showcased- allowing each community to build and tailor their options organically.Consumers- financiers- and technical providers can post a call for proposals for a specific project or just start a conversation with potential partners.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This benefits the current and future players in the renewable energy marketplace. The way that Craigslist or eBay facilitated connections to happen by providing an online platform- we are adding an additional layer of communication to make getting renewable energy easier.Interested teachers can see the options available to their school- whether with energy providers or potential financiers. Homeowners that don't have the funds to install renewable energy can find a grant focused on this switch in their area and the company to make the switch. Addressing all needs in one marketplace - the demand- the supply- and the money - we give people the space to proactively seek solutions tailored to their needs.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Currently the available marketplaces are geared towards individual homeowners with the capital to finance such changes. This online network makes the entire idea of switching to renewable energy more accessible for a variety of different organizations and groups.This easy access- and partnerships built between technical providers and financiers- will allow the idea of switching to renewable energy easier.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We would first test the concept on a very small and localized scale. Using a lean start-up methodology of 'concierge service' where we will provide our service to a very small number of people- learn from this- iterate- and organically grow. To start- we would find 5 different types of consumers. Working exclusively with those groups/individuals- we would help them identify their best renewable energy options. Then we would reach out to current providers (and funders depending on the need) and facilitate that connection. From learning about this type of interaction with the customers- funders- and providers- we would then do a second iteration of this. During this time- we would also build a minimum viable product of a marketplace and start using this to facilitate those connections. This approach would allow us to learn and pivot accordingly.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love to hear about:- attempts to do similar partnerships- including any models to specifically show - any alternative models or financing options to complete renewable energy projects. - examples of this in other sectors - specific groups/individuals/businesseswith whom that we could test this idea out- general feedback to build on this idea- different ways to test this</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An OpenIDEO Meetup</p>","4","With proper planning and data use, this could be a plan that works for a long while.","The easier it is to implement for people, the more willing they would be participate","Since you are putting so much effort into this, I think you are laying the groundwork for it to be a success.","4","4","4"

Using only gravity and water- the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to rotate and follow the sun throughout the day- boostingefficiency by 30%. It also produces clean water!The SunSaluter is built from common components and is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized panel rotators (called trackers)- and is much more durable without complex components.Solar power is a proven way to alleviate energy poverty- but it is simply still too expensive for many poor consumers. By increasing efficiency and lowering the overall cost per watt- the SunSaluter can help communities afford the transition to clean energy!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The SunSaluter is ideal for poor- rural individuals living without electricity. These individuals earn just dollars a day and often spend more than 20% of their income on kerosene gas and walk hours just to charge their cell phones. Solar energy is a great tool for eliminating these problems- but it is often still too expensive up-front for them. By boosting efficiency and lowering the cost per watt of solar energy- the SunSaluter brings solar energy within reach. For example- a 150 watt solar lantern charging station which powers 75 lanterns can be outfitted with a SunSaluter to be capable of charging 25 more lanterns. The individuals living in unelectrified communities also often lack access to clean water- so the SunSaluter provides a great additional benefit.For example- at the OneMama Clinic in Kirindi- Uganda- a SunSaluter installation has allowed women at the health clinic to not only eliminate the usage of kerosene- but to create a phone charging business to bolster their income.“The mamas are so excited that this is bringing light into an area where they spend the most time- which is in the Kitchen area- and also bringing energy for them to charge cell phones and purifying water- so we’re using it for tea and for cooking dinner. The OneMama Clinic is very grateful to SunSaluter for bringing its wonderful technology to the OneMama Clinic and to Uganda.”- Siobhan Neilland- Founder of OneMama</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By boosting the efficiency of solar panels by 30%- the SunSaluter lowers the overall cost per watt of solar energy and simply makes it more affordable. Excellent solar technology is already available in many markets - but cost is still a primary barrier to widespread adoption. The SunSaluter is also unique in that it be installed with new solar systems or used to retrofit existing systems. With over 2 gigawatts of off-grid solar capacity currently installed worldwide- the solar infrastructure upon which to use the SunSaluter already exists- and is growing every day. The SunSaluter is simple to build and requires no special equipment nor training- meaning any community can adopt it rapidly. Lastly- if we can get local entrepreneurs to manufacture and distribute their own SunSaluters- costs will decrease dramatically and hopefully instill confidence in the community to adopt the technology.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have already deployed over 100 SunSaluters around the world - and every time we learn something new! Regarding outsourced manufacturing- we are beginning to work with a village in northern India where the locals will build their own SunSaluters and can either use them- sell them- or resell them back to us to provide our other customers. We will be making at least 30 systems with them in the coming months- and would really love to learn how to make the process beneficial to everyone involved. We are happy to try any suggestions that people have. And of course we're open to trying this approach with other partners around the world!</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would be grateful for any recommendations on how to set up a human-centered manufacturing and distribution partnership with these communities. What can we do to make sure it is beneficial to the community members- but also ensure standards of quality and reliability for us? What should we make sure not to do?

While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community.

[UPDATED 7 Feb - video]</h2><p>Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount. Every time the pasteurize using our cow-poop powered system- they prevent methane emissions and make more money.Industrial milk producers - Most milk is processed at large processing plants which are huge energy hogs. We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine. Save calves through affordable milk pasteurization.Others - We are also looking at raw milk- home cheesemakers- and others.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By embedding renewables within the dairy system- we change the renewables challenge and value proposition by making it one component of an income-generating product. Users can produce more electricity than they need- so they can also retail electricity to neighbors and others.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have talked to farmers in Costa Rica- China- and the US and we think there is a real need for our product. We do not yet have FDA approval for our new technology and one question we are trying to answer is if people in under-regulated markets will accept our technology (eg. small rural farmers in emerging economies- aged cheesemakers- raw milk drinkers- others) before we go through this long process. For the US- we are testing this now.

To overcome these competitors- reductions in the cost of manufacturing as well as improved efficiency and range of operating conditions need to be addressed. Hydrogen production costs and handling also will require reductions to the scale that petroleum refineries enjoy today. The Honda fuel cell FCX Clarity vehicle is rated at 59 mpg-e (mile per gallon equivalent to gasoline). If outfitted with the proposed enhanced fuel cell membranes the mileage would increase to 82.6 mpg-e.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>A report by Transparency Market Research states the global fuel cells market was valued at US$355.3 million in 2011 and is projected to grow to US$910.3 million by 2018 led by the stationary segment expected to reach a market size of $4.17 billion by 2019.The initial target market is MEA manufacturers serving the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) segment- specifically those operating at low temperature in small stationary- transportation and portable applications. The market was selected because the technology has the greatest known impact on systems operating at low temperatures. Widespread use of PEMFC technology is due to low operating temperature- rapid start up capabilities- favorable power density/size ratio and the ability to vary output in matching power demand shifts also favored selection of this market.PEMFC is the most dominant form of fuel cell- accounting for over 40% of global installed capacity and close to 88% market share in 2013. Applications include forklifts- automobiles- telecommunications- data centers- primary and backup power systems.MEA manufacturers will be critical users of the process method integrated/outsourced with their existing or potential high throughput capabilities that would drive additional cost reduction requirements of supported catalyst manufacture. Target companies also harbor relationships with PEMFC manufacturers critical in understanding industry component development needs- providing performance validation and cost reductions facilitating widespread adaption of the product.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Customer interviews identified that catalysts have to be more resistant to CO- which the technology achieves by reducing the impact of CO introduced by the ambient air supply to the operating environment.The true value resides in increased power output capabilities. For example- a 3kW fuel cell system without the enhancement costs $14-800 or $4-933/kW. With the enhancement- the system output would increase to 4.2 kW and cost $3-524/kW. This translates to fuel consumption efficiency across all applications. Using the 3 kW fuel cell example- the system consumes 39 L/min Max H2 at full power. With the enhancement the system does the same work but only consumes 23.4 L/min (40% less).</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The goal of this project is to deliver a nanoparticle enhanced membrane to a commercial MEA partner for 3rd party evaluation as to the claims and merits of this breakthrough technology.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Subject Matter Experts in the Fuel Cell Industry and others with overall interest in growing the renewable energy industry in the US.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p>","3","A lot of people don't understand the fuel industry, so it would be hard to get people involved.","This is a really complicated idea for people to understand.","If you could break it down in simpler terms for people, I think they would be interested.","3","3","3"

UPDATE Feb 9</h2><p>Communities can make themselves independent by using their daily waste to produce energy.[UPDATE_FEB1ST] In Germany there is a community of 180 people nearby Berlin which are completely autarc from national power-plants. Read their story below![UPDATE_FEB9TH] Thanks to the great help of Emily from IDEO- who got inspired by the idea- we now have a beautiful visual to help understand the simplicity of the small homemade anaerobic digester (micro-biogas-plant) >> Check it out :-)</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea can benefit any kind of community that produces waste. The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached)</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached). We could organise building workshops- so that the people can see changes instantly.[UPDATE_FEB9TH] WORKSHOP_As it was of short notice - and we already took part in another workshop together with Otto Scharmer from Presencing institute MIT (which was great) in Berlin last Friday - we will have the workshop around the end of february. I will keep everybody involved updated on that - we will do it no matter how the idea proceeds now :-) It is amazing to see how many people are excited about this. FOR EXAMPLE_ I talked to a dear friend of mine during the Otto Scharmer workshop and we came up with an idea of combining the anaerobic digester and a filtersystem for water. He (the friend) has been in Bhutan- where pure water is a scarcity in some regions- due to lack of good canalization etc. So we are looking into possibilities of building a combination of both systems. The digester would be able to fuel the pumping-system and help the water to circulate more thoroughly. I am excited :-) [END OF UPDATE]</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Fueled by some great people here at openIDEO I am planning to pre-pone (?) the workshop on building gas-lamps out of plastic-bottles and do it in Munich or Berlin the following two weeks! Sounds fun? Get connected :-) I am certain- that many of you have been working voluntarily in one or another developmental surrounding in Vietnam- Pakistan- India or the African continent. There - in the rural area - this is quite a common form of producing energy for cooking and heating. So you have the knowledge or connections and could get these little DIY workshops started!
