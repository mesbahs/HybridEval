I think real estate more than banking prefers it's customers with as little info as possible. Most real estate companies are more worried about their bottom line than building sustainable communities. They ignore the part of housing- residential rentals- where most low-middle incomers dwell. And where the most support is needed for property owners to reduce risk so capital flows.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I was able to discuss with a community bank- how they could get better and more info on renters from the property owners they finance. They only make multifamily loans and the gov't wants to make sure the funds are really improving communities. I did classes at the CHA on sustainable communities for a year and talked to countless owners renting to low income people on housing assistance vouchers.

Making information transparent and connecting people will ultimately strengthen communities and local business- specifically financial services because they'll be able to gather realtime data they've never had access to before helping them development new services and programs geared to reach specific end users. We'll allow them a way to maintain a monthly dialog with users to help them stay on the path.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>What the founder of Tactile Finance learned about the real estate and banking industries isn't even the half of it. I think real estate more than banking prefers it's customers with as little info as possible. Most real estate companies are more worried about their bottom line than building sustainable communities. They ignore the part of housing- residential rentals- where most low-middle incomers dwell. And where the most support is needed for property owners to reduce risk so capital flows.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I was able to discuss with a community bank- how they could get better and more info on renters from the property owners they finance. They only make multifamily loans and the gov't wants to make sure the funds are really improving communities. I did classes at the CHA on sustainable communities for a year and talked to countless owners renting to low income people on housing assistance vouchers. And I operated a property management company for 10 years- I understand how to help this market.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>http://firstround.com/review/Dropboxs-Head-of-Design-on-the-Dawn-of-Personalized-Products/ I initially thought we had a ux designer but have discovered I was mistaken so I still need help there and also looking for a dynamic programmer. Both people need to design and program with an eye on where their industry is headed as much as where it is now. And both should have the ability to create on their own from a concept. Some only thrive when being given explicit direction- need free thinkers.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An individual</p>","3","","","","2","3","2"

This could also provide an opportunity to test the impact that social currency of helping out someone in need has on individual's sense of accomplishment and resulting desire to contribute.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>It takes a community to build a community so i'd seek the OpenIDEO community to provide feedback on what they would value most from such a program (as a borrower or investor). I would determine the value of social currency- poll users to get a feel for risk tolerance- acceptable collateral- what role the CU industry could play to create a secure and trustworthy community where transactions could occur.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>Other</p>","3","","","","3","3","3"

Access to traditional financial services is not a requirement; the app can help manage spending for anyone that users payment systems that are connected digitally - traditional banks- Paypal- digital currencies- etc.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>A key element of this tool is the ability to use community benchmarks to better understand spending patterns- and share spending/saving behaviors with others in your network. We believe that opportunities to make anonymous comparisons with other people in similar situations and share positive financial behaviors openly within your network spread knowledge and encourage positive decisions.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>There are opportunities to test the contextually relevant budget capability using a behavioral test at a local grocery store - participants would be presented with budget information and details on their past spending as they enter the store- and a follow-up interview would assess the impact on their spending. Similar small prototypes could be created to test the impact of personalized rewards (iTunes/Netflix) on weekly spending as well as benefits associated with social budgeting/benchmarking.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>It would be great to receive input across a few key questions - What causes individuals to loose track of their budget?- What are locations when it would be helpful to receive advice/information about your spending?- What are other incentives beyond iTunes/Netflix that users would want to receive daily/weekly/monthly as a reward for positive spending behavior?</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","4","i think that companies that want to learn more about spending habits might buy into this","it seems like a good way to learn more about good financial habits but i worry about privacy issues","developing and maintaining the app may cost a lot","2","3","4"

The users would be parents- teachers- school employees- and the students- of course. This is targeting kids from K to 5th grade.

From an early age- parents can teach their children about the importance of money and helping others by implementing some rules in their households. For example- if their kids misbehaved in day core/school- the parents take away their treats and save it for the kids that are poor. This way the kids behave- parents help out another family in need.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>Parents can share their household rules with neighbors and families.

It also links helping others to punishment.","It seems very feasible to implement and wouldn't cost a ton of money if the amounts specified in the example were used.

However- the perspectives have changed graduallyandwomen become more and more independent especially in the economic aspect even some women may be more powerful in the economic position than men. And the whole society develops quite dramatically with the financial independence of women.

There are also tax considerations. One concern I have from the proposal is the assumption that there will be consistent profitability - which is unlikely.

The end user for this idea (the would-be borrower) is arguably a person who needs financial education the most- is coming to the CU community for a solution.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I lead a team of financial literacy specialists at Patelco Credit Union (one of the larger CUs in the US). Our team has begun connection with members who have been declined for loans to learn if this is an idea that might benefit them. The response is an overwhelming 'yes!'</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Helping write program guidelines and general input from finance professionals.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","2","","","","3","2","3"
