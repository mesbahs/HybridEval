As a caregiver- I looked for books that would help. I was overwhelmed and couldn't bring myself to read all of the words in any one of the books I found- so I wrote and illustrated 12 Tiny Well-being Tips for Caregivers. First I tell our story- followed by hands on exercises designed to help caregivers own their reality while acknowledging their own resourcefulness. It's visual- simple and inspiring.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I've already sold and given away several of my books.The reviews have been really good (blushing).One thing that I've learned is that when I'm ready to print my next round of books... It'll most likely be a soft cover so that I can give out even more. We've met with caregiver's- given out books- listened to their stories- acknowledged their efforts and hugged them.It's been amazing so far.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>I need help streamlining my ideas.I'm an artist so it's easy to go in a bazillion different directions.I need help creating a sound plan as I expand and offer additional creative- visual tools for caregivers.As mentioned- I'm on a teeny- tiny budget but have so many ideas... another book- organizers- greeting cards- etc... I'm an overwhelmed creative caregiver who needs an ear- a shoulder and an angel to help me see this idea come to life as it truly should.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>I've been a life & business visual coach since 2008. Every client walks away with a visual representation of our session together. I'm also a visual facilitator. I draw out each workshop or seminar I offer. I love to create and find that it's the best way to connect with the core of another person.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>I’m Robin Albright and I have a book that helps caregivers remember to take care of themselves as they care for others. It’s called 12 Tiny We’ll-being Tips for Caregivers. It’s visual- unlike most books with a gazillion words that overwhelm the already overwhelmed caregiver. I also have other heart-felt products that will be out in the future - also designed to help Caregivers cope.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>It's just a matter of time (confident I guess).I'm hoping to collaborate with large organizations down the road.I just sent a copy of my book and a few cards to someone at AARP... hoping to gain recognition.I just need to continue to move forward and watch what happens.I am operating from a place of LARGE HOPE.:) OH! I'm also doing guest spots on podcasts and blogs.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>I get feedback and of course... sales increase from word of mouth- etc... Phone calls asking me to do a workshop/seminar... sharing my story... watching the eyes of those in the audience... etc...</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>I continue to work on selling what I have and then applying the profits to buy more cards- books etc... so that I can continue to sell them.We hope to continue traveling- speaking- hugging caregivers and selling my inventory (and giving away some too- of course).:)</p>","4","Depending on the advice it should be able to stand by itself.","Caregivers tend to focus too much on the demented person, forgetting they have to care for themself as well.

The ability to understand that their loved one is not behaving normally because they can't- rather than because they won't- is an essential part of becoming a more patient and compassionate caregiver.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>In 2016- we did a pilot study with a Chicago area medical school. Data showed that The Alfred Lab increased interest in geriatrics- enhanced perspective-taking for medical students- and decreased negative stereotyping of older adults. Because this pilot data showed efficacy- we are now doing another study with a long term care facility- where both of our labs are being used to assess how our labs affect resident care in staff & volunteers- as well as being used for family education of residents.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Collaboration is a highly valued part of Embodied Labs company culture. We would love for the OpenIDEO community to be able to give us valuable feedback from our potential end-users -- the family caregivers who need so much support to do what they do everyday. We would love to hear what they need and what they would like to see in a human experience library designed to help them understand the perspectives of their loved ones as they care for them in their journey through dementia.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm A student collaboration An Individual</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Embodied Labs has existed as a company since August of 2016. Our co-founders- employees- and advisors have combined expertise and life experience in VR film-making- software development- curriculum design- medical illustration- dementia caregiving- neurology- counseling- and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Embodied Labs creates immersive virtual reality experiences that allow family care partners to embody a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our most recent VR lab takes the learner on journey through the stages of AD- where they experience the 1st person perspective of someone with AD- interact with their world using their own hands and voice- and learn about what is happening inside the brain.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Our current subscribers purchase VR hardware and a subscription to our software. Embodied Labs is looking for partner who could put investment into putting our software in public libraries- allowing care partners to utilize our content for free. Many public libraries are already investing in VR hardware or have received it from VR companies- making this a realistic model. Also- our long term care customers are already using our software to create programming for resident families and the public.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The future of hardware is in high fidelity VR as it transitions from desktop to an affordable mobile/wireless solution in 2018 or early 2019. We are building content for where the tech will be in 1-2 years- but are able to implement our idea now to test and optimize its efficacy. The data we are tracking with our current customer channels will allow us to scale to the consumer market when the tech is able to deliver higher quality video- richer interactivity--and deliver it through smart phones.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We took the prototype that we developed for our pilot study and have now begun to measure the impact around two main themes- using the built-in assessments that are part of our application: 1) Personal experience: what have been your experiences caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease? What has been positive? What has been difficult? 2) Disease knowledge: what do you know about Alzheimer's disease? How can learning more about how the disease affects the brain make you a better caregiver?</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>1) We will use the feedback we gathered this past month and will continue to gather from our pilot long term care facility to launch a full version of our product. 2) We will make another VR lab for our platform that is centered around the topic that our current subscribers voted is the most important to them. 3) We will look for partnerships to get software to care partners into public spaces now- while building a product that will scale well when hi-fidelity hardware is more wireless/mobile.</p>","3","VR use might increase over time.

These three items combine to benefit families through lowered medical costs and reduced guilt through collaboration.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are starting with a 1-month alpha that includes Leslie and her sister tracking and monitoring their mother's health routines. We will then begin a closed beta with 5 families who provide care for a senior with Alzheimer's and Diabetes. The beta will last 3-months as we track metrics and milestones that validate our mission of increased patient medical compliance and collaboration.

My mother- at age 72- became my caregiver while I was fighting stage IV cancer. During this difficult time- I felt guilty that I made her age a lot- and today I worry more about her as she turns 77- especially recently when I had to take her to the ER and she became hospitalized. This dynamic role shift has enabled me to see how scary and stressful caregiving can be.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We conducted >100 interviews and tested our product in elder centers across SF. Our research revealed two most popular activities in elder centers. 1. music and dance- and 2. cross-generation activities. We are applying for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community fund with two local non-profits to set up a cross-generation program. University AME Zion Church is the oldest African American church in Palo Alto- already offer tech education program. InATalent brings teenagers to dance with seniors.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We were amazed by the data in the design brief- especially the personas provided by IDEO.org- and the journey map provided by AgingWellHub. We are excited to see countless great ideas submitted to the site and already see opportunities for potential collaboration. We are grateful that our favorite company- IDEO- has a similar focus that is so close to our heart.

Stage IV cancer pushed me to dedicate my life to innovate and improve both patient and caregiver experience. I was also trained in social entrepreneurship at Stanford and Singularity University.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Caregiving can be very stressful. Dance4Healing is an AI-powered tele-exercise platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected- increase accessibility to group exercise- and build healthy habits in a fun way. Our mission is to reduce caregivers’ stress- combat isolation- and improve both emotional and physical health by bringing dance- community- and cross-generational support to home care.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Dance4Healing is designed for accessibility with a tiered model. Our target customers are Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly- Medicare Advantage Plans- and Elder Centers. The basic platform with 40 pre-recorded dance videos is $250/month/location. Caregivers can access the platform at elder centers or from home with no charge. Customized content can be created based on their preference to increase engagement. All the programs only need a computer- wifi- and willing participants!</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We are working with OnLok to launch a program designed to reduce anxiety and depression for dementia patients and caregivers. We plan to scale to 233 PACE centers nationwide- serving over 40-000 participants. OnLok founded PACE for the government and is internationally recognized as an eldercare leader. PACE also relieves the burden of caregivers by offering breaks that enable them to better focus on their mental and physical health- and allowing them to spend more time with their families.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Impact will be measured by tracking how many classes caregivers attend- how long they dance- which videos they use- and how they feel before and afterwards. Sensor tracking will be implemented via partnership. Clinical measurements like Zarit Burden Scale Short and CESD-10 has been recommended by our clinical partner- Stanford professor Dolores Thompson- expert on reduce stress- anxiety and depression for dementia family caregivers- a 25 year Geropsychologist and NIH funded researcher.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our next steps are working with partners and potential funders. 1. OnLok- launch an anxiety and depression reduction program for dementia patients/caregivers. 2. Avenidas- start test the program at their centers. 3. RWJF: advised by program officer Michael Painter to apply for pioneer grant. 4. Moore Foundation: encouraged by President Harvey Fineberg to apply for community health grant. 5.

The report finds caregivers on average spend $7-000 on caregiving per year- which goes toward paying for personal- medical and household needs. While Alzheimer’s/dementia caregivers spend- on average- 54% more. Genivity helps caregivers understand and plan early for care costs to help protect their financial future.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>While many aspects of caregiving have been previously studied- financial caregiving remains largely unexamined. We are currently working with financial advisors who are interested in providing caregiving and care planning solutions to their clients. We want to more closely track results from these planning conversations to show how this risk information helps caregivers save more today for retirement so their own care needs will be covered after caregiving.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Feedback on our caregiver experience and help with how to display care cost and disability information in a sensitive yet educational way to families.

She brings a decade of sales- marketing and market development experience to Genivity from her time in the medical device industry working for Medtronic & Abbott Vascular.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>We want to make sure no one runs out of money in retirement because of unforeseen medical expenses. Genivity helps caregivers protect themselves financially so they can stay on track with their own retirement planning while still being able to provide and pay for care for their loved one suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>HALO by Genivity is a scalable solution that is flexible in its application. As such- HALO is something that employers would implement as part of their wellness programs to enable broad access to our solution. The cost of implementation would fall to organizations and companies as part of their benefits and ongoing care of employees and their families.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Due to the flexible nature of the HALO by Genivity solution- it can be easily scaled to reach large audiences. The solution can be embedded directly on an organization's website (or hosted by Genivity) to give full and immediate access to anyone with the unique URL.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We measure the impact of HALO for caregivers in several ways: The first metric is usage. We look at how many people are using HALO from a specific organization as well as how many people start the assessment yet never finish. This enables us to understand where we can better improve our experience and how well its being promoted by the organization.

From a technology standpoint- Genivity recently brought on a highly-experienced CTO who is leading the way for integrations with other platforms to help scale quickly.</p>","4","Service seems to be able to stand on its own.

Education is provided through an e-learning component and cognitive feedback offered during the scenario-based serious game. Additionally- the scenario-based tool offers a safe- virtual environment where caregivers can test coping strategies and experience the implications of their actions in realistic and recognizable scenarios.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>This idea has already been evaluated through several focus groups of caregivers of individuals with dementia in Flanders- Belgium and was also evaluated by several clinicians as part of a masters thesis at the University of Leuven in Belgium. These initial focus groups provided excellent input from the target audience into the needs and expectations for such a tool. Additional focus groups could also be carried out in other jurisdictions where the company operates- such as North America.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>The most interesting input from the OpenIDEO community would be related to how can we bring this evidence-based educational tool from demo stage to the market. Due to the complexity in healthcare and the robust number of stakeholders involved it's not clear as to the best route that we can take to get this tool into the hands of end users. That being said- we have finalized a plan for the European market in collaboration with dementia stakeholders in Flanders- Belgium.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>My background is healthcare - I spent 3 years working in clinical trial management of large-scale clincial trials before shifting gears to my current position. In my current role of Scientific Integration Expert I ensure that scientific evidence is translated into our educational tools.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>MindBytes is developing an evidence-based educational tool that consists of a scenario-based serious game and an e-learning to reduce burden of informal caregivers. All content has been derived from scientific literature and validated with experts. The serious game has been tested in four focus groups of informal caregivers. Dementia stakeholders in Belgium have confirmed the need of such a tool.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We expect that MIB Coping Dementia will be provided to end users at no- or minimal- cost. Our intention is to license the tool to regional dementia patient and caregiver networks focusing on established family groups. Two elements that will facilitate this is the low barrier for moderators and the forthcoming online accessibility. This will ensure that MIB Coping Dementia is accessible to all those that wish to attend an in-person session or use it independently at home.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We have a clear plan for scalability in Flanders- which will serve as proof-of-concept for other regions. As dementia advocacy and support groups operate at regional levels- we will focus on marketing MIB Coping Dementia to regional groups such as Alzheimer's Society- Alzheimer's Association- etc. We have well-established connections with such groups outside of Belgium and plan to move into new European countries each year starting in 2019. We will initiate a simultaneous plan for North America.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>The impact of our idea can be measured at a personal level by integrating questionnaires into the tool and analyzing outcomes over time. Alternatively it could be measured at the regional level by evaluating pooled user data such as: number of users- times accessed- outcomes- etc.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our immediate next steps are to finalize the e-learning and integrate the package into an online environment. This will be carried out in close collaboration with Flemish dementia experts. We have submitted a grant application in Belgium and expect to receive an update in Q1 2018. The intention is to launch the finalized version in September 2018 in collaboration with the dementia stakeholders who are already onboard (clinicians- academics- government- advocacy- healthcare funds- etc.).</p>","4","The user tests validate that such product is being liked.

It is a way to enable passive communication using existing daily routines- or habituated appliances such as a kettle. Because it uses existing routines it can also be a reliable way of passively monitoring if an elderly user has been active.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have been working on ourfunctional prototype and have established connections with two large aged care providers to help test our prototypes and find out how effective they are.We are working closely with these two aged care providers in South East Queensland as well as a research team at the Queensland University of Technology to run user testing and feedback sessions with elderly users to sculpt the product into something that will be easily adopted.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We see OpenIDEO as a great platform to bring to light many of the issues faced by this community- and in doing so- provide a network of like minded people to help create solutions- enable aging in place- and break down the stigma of aging.The greater community will see long term benefits as well- with a load taken off healthcare systems and aged care providers as the solutions created off the back of this program begin to alleviate people's dependence- and provides them with autonomy</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Our ever expanding team has an array of experience from health and fitness- software engineering- user experience- business and design.

This device can be effective for caregivers with loved ones at an early stage of dementia- allowing for ageing in place through the device's passive monitoring ability. This same device has already caught the attention of nursing homes aiming to a reduce invasive checkups on their permanent residential patients.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Conpago is focusing heavily on the user feedback from end users- especially caregivers of individuals the early to mid stages of dementia. This is the primary way we plan to measure the impact of our idea- since our goals are aimed towards assisting caregivers. The secondary way of measuring the impact of our idea is the increase of independence given to caregivers by using the Conpago Companion- through the use of task distribution through the Conpago app.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Conpago will continue to refine the Companion in order to give end users the best experience possible. We will look continue to look for funding so that we can push this product to the international market. Conpago aims to alleviate the burdens that caregivers have by implementing any new innovations that appear in the world of tech- whilst ensuring people with dementia maintain a good standard of living by allowing them to have as much independence for as long as possible.</p>","1","Unclear what it does.","Unclear what the product does amd how it looks like.

Patients are connected with their families through a personalized music device and mobile application. The device is used by the patient and managed by their family members or caregivers through the app. When the patient does not remember a face- a sound is used in place to “remind” the user and trigger memories.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have evidence that proves the concept could work for some and we want to dedicate more time to using music to try to awaken memories with individuals across various stages of Alzheimer's- and together with caregivers and at nursing homes. We also feel the design of both the app and tangible music player needs to be refined for both the caregiver and person living with Alzheimer's respectively- therefore we would continue crafting and testing mockups and prototypes until it's good enough.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We'd appreciate any help that gets us closer to not only bringing this project to life- but improves the system and experience we are proposing.

We all graduated together from Umeå Institute of Design a few years ago. We have diverse professional backgrounds between us- including work in healthcare and wellness.</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>It is a digital music player and application designed for people with Alzheimer's.Along with the well-known benefits of music- their songs help them remember who they are- but there wasn't a music player on the market that has been designed for their specific needs. So we designed one- along with a platform for caregivers so that they can manage the music library and music therapy.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Throughout our design process we have prioritized solving usability issues that people face- such as loss of dexterity- poor vision- etc. Concerning accessibility in terms of cost- organizations such as Music and Memory are dedicated to the efforts of sourcing and distributing mp3 players- as well as recruiting volunteers. We aim to keep our price below the ones they currently use- to make our Remind system an opportunity for everyone.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Remind is a system that includes both a device and software- but we plan to design a version of the ios and android app that can be used without our music player- but instead using existing personal devices- speakers- and headphones. The concept can not include some of the features but will be scalable as long as there is music. We will educate people on how to use it through the website.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>By observing people use it- as well as feedback- stories from caregivers and nursing home workers on their experiences using the music system with their care-recipient. Since this an emotional topic- we want to provide a space for users to share the success and challenges they have in an open forum- to help them help each other strengthen their relationships while spreading awareness of Remind.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>During this phase we have gathered more feedback and refined the physical design of the music player. Next steps are to improve the UX/UI of the companion application and web platform- so that we can get it all back in the hands of our users for further testing.</p>","4","Recognition by sounds seems like something that will last.

Many caregivers can handle caring for their loved one aside from the obstacles that interfere. However- as the disease advances to its middle stages where behavior becomes more difficult to handle- caregivers may fall in a state of depression and isolation.

A card game as it is an inexpensive way of promoting vital conversations- as well as being a familiar activity (playing cards) to most people.

To maximise our reach we will partner with charity organisations (e.g. Alzheimer Society UK) to spread awareness. As models of dementia care develop from residential to home care- we believe we have a role to play- eg. services which train informal care givers to care for their loved ones in their own home- would benefit from it</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We would aim to pilot the tool and hold focus groups with participants to receive feedback. We would like to measure “sense of confidence” about the future before and after using the cards. We would also like to know what actions have come from having the conversations promoted by the cards- as well as whether people would recommend the game to others.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>We are aiming to approach the services which we have identified are key to reaching the people who will benefit most from our game.

We have created a library of VR “experiences” (e.g. calm lake- tranquil garden) that aim to stimulate psychological/cognitive health by decreasing depression- anxiety- and aggression and reducing wandering.

This project focuses on the design of playful sensory experiences that have the potential to address the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. It is also a toolset for caregivers to better manage and conduct sensory-based activities.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>With a robust prototype in the works for Spring 2018- my goal is to maintain regular visits to one of the communities we're working with- sharing weekly prototypes and gathering feedback.We also plan to conduct playtest sessions and workshops with caregivers- in collaboration with the USC Family Caregiver Support Center- making sure we also have the perspective from those caring for loved ones at home.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>As we prepare for our first pilot next semester to collect feasibility data and build an initial case study- our project could benefit from guidance in how we could start consolidating the idea for a larger scale deployment- moving from a MFA thesis to an actual product- or experience package- as we like to call it.

Experience with interaction design- visual design and film. More: www.aboutgabi.com</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>A smart platform that allows caregivers to transform spaces through light- color- sounds and visuals- turning any space into a place where people with dementia can focus and relax. Inspired by the research legacy of traditional Multisensory Environments (MSEs)- our app works together with Philips Hue smart lights- and is designed to extend the virtual experience into the physical space.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We use commercially available off-the-shelf components and take into consideration the reusability of each component in other aspects of care. We chose to design this smart platform as an app for the iPad because it gives caregivers and our end users instant portable access to not only our experiences- but also to a whole ecosystem of applications and resources. We also adopted a modular design approach. Healing Spaces is made to work with both low-end and high-end setups (see Setup infographic)</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>In its post-thesis life- Healing Spaces would be available for download in the App Store- and would also have a robust online presence- a centralized place where caregivers can find extensive documentation- resources and updates- learn more about sensory-based activities and engage with the community. I would love this home page to encourage users to build upon our tools- and share their own experiences with our product- allowing us to keep creating content that is fresh and meaningful.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We’ll be conducting a feasibility study in a memory care community in late February. Our goal is to examine if Healing Spaces helps reduce agitation in persons with dementia- if it is engaging for both users- and if it makes sensory-based activities easier & more enjoyable. We'll be using two assessment tools to measure agitation and engagement- as well as direct observation notes- surveys and interviews with caregivers. Results will be shared in the form of a case study.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>- Finalize pilot study design- measurable outcomes and IRB application. - Incorporate Alpha prototype feedback to new iteration and content creation. - Refine and polish prototype for the pilot study- focusing on simplicity -core features and meaningful content. - Maintain weekly visits to the community- showing staff a new iteration of the prototype each week.</p>","3","Is dependent on Philips hue, unsure if it works.","Don't know if it works, but it sounds fun.","Possible with hue bulbs.","4","3","3"

Caregivers: stress/depression reduction; opportunity to network with each other. Students: insightful workforce development experience as they join the fight against Alzheimer’s disease and develop an interest in fields of aging.

The program has had zero accidents. 88% of students rated the program at least 4 out of 5 and 100% of them marked ‘would recommend to a friend’. 87% of caregivers mentioned this program brought a ‘significant’ stress reduction and 73% of them mentioned this program alone offered enough weekly respite.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered.

First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs. Our surveys will primarily assess increased interest in areas of Alzheimer’s and aging (students)- degree of stress relief (caregivers)- and how meaningful the program is (seniors).

This idea supports appropriate expressions of empathy by rates of dementia in major ethnic groups and healthcare providers. Culturally appropriate expressions of empathy prevent disruptive behaviors and reduce isolation in care recipients. Use of empathy as a caregiving tool provides caregivers with a greater sense of control and reduces burnout in them.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Find several family caregivers for an informal discussion about empathy and current ways they used. Obtain family caregivers' perceptions about empathy as a caregiving tool.

Assess their appropriateness for use with family caregivers. - Provide guidance for developing empathy assessment tools. - Provide guidance for testing assessment tools with family members. - Identify effective ways to identify differences in the cultural expression of empathy by major ethnic groups. - Provide guidance on setting up Empathy Training Bootcamps. - Brainstorm on deployment techniques.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm An Individual</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Our group included the following: - A business owner that provides respite care for persons with Dementia.- Writer/interviewer from Memory Well - Participants who have family members with Dementia - AARP staff person who had observed a variety of family caregivers and their loved ones.</p>","2","By taking account multiple cultures it is up to date with the latest trends.

Initially- it helps users maintain their own confidence and independence and adapts to invite more family support as it detects life changes. Users and families are provided with links to local support groups- networks and helplines each time change is noted. This provides a personal contact point for peer support- a better insight into current and future needs as well as an outlet for emotional release.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Explore current local resources and determine if they need expanding or augmenting. Gain permission to share contacts Ensure people in my community have downloaded the app Add a notification service to the app suggesting local contacts based on current location Track responses to notofications Gather feedback</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>The first version of Prompt by Memrica is on the app store- feedback and suggestions for next steps would be hugely appreciated. Input on the right level of support at the right time and building resources that are accurate- valid and digestable would be very valuable.Familieswho are currently on this journey and who would be interested in co-design- please get in touch!

Previously I led strategy for games for health for a UK developer-partnering with the US Dept of Defense. I helped set up the UK's Serious Games Institute have worked in government policy and started my career as a BBC journalist</p><h4>How would you describe this idea while in an elevator with someone?</h4><p>Prompt is a dementia friend in an app for people with early dementia and their families. It combines a visual diary with context about people and places in reminders with access to in the moment help and information- which are offered when the platform detects changes in patterns of user behaviour.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The current model is to offer the visual diary app for free for people living with early dementia- with an additional small subscription charge for premium services such as family access to analytics that show patterns of behaviour. To date- this has been modelled on £5/$6.69 per month. Feedback from user groups suggests this is affordable and families are willing to pay for peace of mind. An alternative approach is to attract sponsorship from companies who wish to support people with dementia.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The app stores are powerful distribution services; clever marketing is essential for discovery . Translation into multiple languages in the long term will support global reach. Sourcing and collating online information can be achieved through intelligent search. Connecting communities for meaningful- personal support is more challenging; initially we will tap into current support networks to link users to help- and long term will develop local groups of people willing to share their experiences.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Our aim is to keep people with dementia socially active as long as possible- which will help them feel well and in control- which in turn will reduce stress for families. We can use analytics to track patterns of social interaction- baselining when users adopt the app and measuring change. We can compare aggregated results against current known patterns of social decline. We will also ask family users to track their feelings- using emoticons- to see how mood changes when they access support.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>The Prompt app is currently iOS (iPhone and iPad) only- we will be reworking the technology so it can be delivered to any platform- with Android and a web/browser based service for families as priorities. We will be upgrading the analytics to improve the way we can interpret a user's behaviour to see changes and also to predict what they will need. Community tools will also be developed to start the process of building a support service.</p>","4","I'm not sure if the person with dementia will keep using it.","The caregiver part is nice because it tracks the user. For the user it is nice to be reminded on when to do things. Only downside is that an app is difficult to use for a lot of people with dementia.","Looks like it is already in store with some good pricing options.","5","4","3"

Enabling people with dementia to go outdoors on their own and offer space for their caregivers.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Watch me! is designed for people with early-stage dementia. It supports them to overcome their fear of getting lost when going outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. At the same time- it offers a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye. Also- it provides a positive impact on self-esteem and the independence of the person with dementia. The Watch Me! Appthereby provides the opportunity for the caregiver to have more quality time with their loved one or for themselves.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The design came from a collaboration between Pleyade (healthcare)- the University of Technology Eindhoven (research) and Holland Art Group (creative). Together we have formed a design team to develop this concept further for people with dementia and especially their caregivers. In this team we have all expertise required to conduct a follow up field study and improve the design through an iterative process before releasing it as an application.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We would like to constantly reflect with the community on the steps taken in our iterative design process. Our goal is to come to a simple and easy to use Watch me! Application through a process of prototyping- testing- analysing- and refining. Interaction with the community can be very valuable in this approach. Each step of the design process becomes stronger by opening it up and talking to people from different expertise areas.

Is a digital compass that always points home. It supports people with (early stage) dementia to go outdoors on their own- i.e. when going to the bakery. By this it improves their independency and boosts self-esteem. At the same time- it provides a safety net for caregivers to keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. Finally- it gives them relief in the care process and creates free time.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>We want to facilitate accessibility in two ways. Firstly- we will provide the Application for free to everyone worldwide- for smartwatch and smartphone- on Android and iOS devices. Secondly- we will make sure via our iterative and inclusive design proces that people with dementia and caregivers are involved- and that the app remains simple and focuses for them.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Watch me! App is based on the 'homing compass'- and exactly for the reason of scalability we translated it from a standalone device into a widely available software application. This allows the functionality to be distributed easily around the world.</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We intend to evaluate the Watch me! App from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. We will use the quantitative evaluation to assess usefulness and effectiveness- by logging use patterns in the software and monitor the downloads. A qualitative evaluation will be used to develop the interface and conceptual design. At the same time we provide an online platform for feedback from the (user) community. These will give us ample opportunities to constantly improve the application.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>After conducting a thorough redesign iteration in close collaboration with the IDEO community- we intend to conduct a large scale test at Pleyade care organisation. After this- we improve the software- and intend to launch the Watch me!
