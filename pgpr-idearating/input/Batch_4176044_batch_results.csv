Dance4Healing is an AI-powered tele-exercise platform designed to strengthen bonds- stay connected- increase accessibility to group exercise- and build healthy habits in a fun way. Our mission is to reduce caregivers’ stress- combat isolation- and improve both emotional and physical health by bringing dance- community- and cross-generational support to home care.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Our next steps are working with partners and potential funders. 1. OnLok- launch an anxiety and depression reduction program for dementia patients/caregivers. 2. Avenidas- start test the program at their centers. 3. RWJF: advised by program officer Michael Painter to apply for pioneer grant. 4. Moore Foundation: encouraged by President Harvey Fineberg to apply for community health grant. 5. Chan Zuckerberg Fund- launch an intergenerational program pending the result of our grant application.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>I have an extensive background in human-centered design for brands like Yahoo- AT&T- VW- and Sony. Stage IV cancer pushed me to dedicate my life to innovate and improve both patient and caregiver experience. I was also trained in social entrepreneurship at Stanford and Singularity University.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We were amazed by the data in the design brief- especially the personas provided by IDEO.org- and the journey map provided by AgingWellHub. We are excited to see countless great ideas submitted to the site and already see opportunities for potential collaboration. We are grateful that our favorite company- IDEO- has a similar focus that is so close to our heart. We look forward to benefitting from OpenIDEO’s incredible resources and using them to build out and refine our idea.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>We are working with OnLok to launch a program designed to reduce anxiety and depression for dementia patients and caregivers. We plan to scale to 233 PACE centers nationwide- serving over 40-000 participants. OnLok founded PACE for the government and is internationally recognized as an eldercare leader. PACE also relieves the burden of caregivers by offering breaks that enable them to better focus on their mental and physical health- and allowing them to spend more time with their families.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>Dance4Healing is designed for accessibility with a tiered model. Our target customers are Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly- Medicare Advantage Plans- and Elder Centers. The basic platform with 40 pre-recorded dance videos is $250/month/location. Caregivers can access the platform at elder centers or from home with no charge. Customized content can be created based on their preference to increase engagement. All the programs only need a computer- wifi- and willing participants!</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>Impact will be measured by tracking how many classes caregivers attend- how long they dance- which videos they use- and how they feel before and afterwards. Sensor tracking will be implemented via partnership. Clinical measurements like Zarit Burden Scale Short and CESD-10 has been recommended by our clinical partner- Stanford professor Dolores Thompson- expert on reduce stress- anxiety and depression for dementia family caregivers- a 25 year Geropsychologist and NIH funded researcher.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We conducted >100 interviews and tested our product in elder centers across SF. Our research revealed two most popular activities in elder centers. 1. music and dance- and 2. cross-generation activities. We are applying for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community fund with two local non-profits to set up a cross-generation program.

My mother- at age 72- became my caregiver while I was fighting stage IV cancer. During this difficult time- I felt guilty that I made her age a lot- and today I worry more about her as she turns 77- especially recently when I had to take her to the ER and she became hospitalized. This dynamic role shift has enabled me to see how scary and stressful caregiving can be.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A student collaboration</p>","3","I think that there is a great chance for this idea to be viable - it has a good overall overview and from what I read its a good idea that might be ready for implementation.","I think that many people would like the idea as its decent but there might be some apprehension to something that is fairly new and unknown.","There shouldn't be any real issue with implementing this idea - it seems very feasible to me for what it is.","4","3","4"

The more we know about your daily struggles and pain-points- the better we can tailor Hazel’s experience to helping you solve your problems. We’d welcome any feedback- suggestions- and most importantly- if you’re willing to be interviewed by us- or participate in our field trials.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have tested our sensors in a laboratory setting- but we need to retrofit our sensors in a few care-recipients’ homes and monitor them for a period of time to fully validate our methods. During these trials- we’d like to conduct periodic interviews to understand where we can improve our product design to better suit our users needs and preferences. We’d also like to conduct more discovery interviews with caregivers and care-recipients to better understand their daily struggles.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Caregivers constantly visit their loved ones to make sure that they are safe and healthy. Their loved ones often feel interrogated and tend to lash out. This puts stress on their familial bond. With the help of Hazel- caregivers can check in on their loved ones anytime- anywhere- via a mobile app- granting them more personal time. It also softens the tension between both parties by allowing for better conversation during visits; something beyond menial questions like “did you take your pills”.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","4","I'm not sure if this would be different than other products out there but it does have a good focus that should be interesting to caregivers.","This seems like a nice way to reduce tension between patients and family members.","This seems like it could easily use existing technology.","4","4","3"

Whether you are a grandchild or a neighbor of someone with a memory disorder- you know how much the disorder can change the daily life of that individual. We aim to improve the physical and mental well being of everyone involved in the caregiving experience. If you identify as a caregiver and believe Therapalz can make your experience easier- reach out to us at Therapalz@gmail.com and on social media @Therapalz.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Therapalz have been designed alongside users with memory disorders as well as their caregivers in both homes and nursing care facilities. To ensure that the Therapal adds value to caregiving experience- we interview caregivers when developing new features- and then cycle-through the user testing process with individuals memory disorders.

It could even collect and share data with relevant associations and organizations- providing valuable feedback on the state of caregiving and dementia care globally.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I'm currently managing a team of five caregivers- along with four siblings who pitch in to help as necessary. I would be happy to design the template for a comprehensive app that would impact all areas of caregiving and resources for people with dementia.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>Designed for family caregivers- offering valuable and accessible information and tools to help manage behaviour- coordinate family efforts (nothing yet on the market for this!)- keep all data in one central place- watch budgets- find emotional relief- connect with relevant health care professionals and offer an interactive experience for solutions and support. Caregivers are often exhausted from having to seek solutions; this will allow more QUALITY time with loved ones- essential to wellbeing.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>Over 1 year</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>An Individual</p>","2","I don't see how it would stand out in the market from what's already out there.","Sounds like other apps that are already out there.","Any app you want is able to be made now. This would be no different.","4","2","2"

We want to bring them on board whilst we develop the tool- so that we can ensure it is accessible and works with the systems in place.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>We are a team of three- passionate about driving change in healthcare. We work at Bupa-a global healthcare company which funds healthcare around the world and runs clinics- dental centres- hospitals- care homes and retirement villages in a number of countries.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Once we have a prototype- we would like to test the cards with as many people as possible to ensure we have accounted for all the possible things which may be important to care-givers and care-recipients. Testing with the OpenIDEO community will also help us ensure the cards are as inclusive as possible of other cultures.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our idea is simple – two decks of cards with instructions which can be distributed from front line services- such as the NHS Memory Service and Admiral Nurses in the UK. To maximise our reach we will partner with charity organisations (e.g. Alzheimer Society UK) to spread awareness. As models of dementia care develop from residential to home care- we believe we have a role to play- eg. services which train informal care givers to care for their loved ones in their own home- would benefit from it</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The statements chosen for our cards are the result of our conversations with relatives and care givers and relevant to both the care-giver and care-recipient. A card game as it is an inexpensive way of promoting vital conversations- as well as being a familiar activity (playing cards) to most people. We are exploring the possibility of an online version as well as testing across different countries. Our early conversations give us confidence that the game can be translated and localised.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We would aim to pilot the tool and hold focus groups with participants to receive feedback. We would like to measure “sense of confidence” about the future before and after using the cards. We would also like to know what actions have come from having the conversations promoted by the cards- as well as whether people would recommend the game to others.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We will be testing our idea with the family caregivers and mental health nurses we interviewed during our research phase. We will also be testing the idea with a professor who has over 25 years experience in dementia care and is internationally recognised for his authority on dementia care practice and policy.Secondly- we would like to test the idea with care homes in Spain- New Zealand and Australia (to test the idea cross-culturally) and local community groups working with elderly people.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>The idea is designed for both- family caregivers and their loved ones at the early stages of being diagnosed withdementia- to support a meaningful conversation about what really matters - to them- as individuals and together.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","5","The developer has already thought of who they can  partner up with so it seems like this idea would be viable.","It seems like a fun and easy way to engage people with dementia.","The technology is simple and the developer has a clear plan.","5","5","5"

We want to bring them on board whilst we develop the tool- so that we can ensure it is accessible and works with the systems in place.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>We are a team of three- passionate about driving change in healthcare. We work at Bupa-a global healthcare company which funds healthcare around the world and runs clinics- dental centres- hospitals- care homes and retirement villages in a number of countries.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>Once we have a prototype- we would like to test the cards with as many people as possible to ensure we have accounted for all the possible things which may be important to care-givers and care-recipients. Testing with the OpenIDEO community will also help us ensure the cards are as inclusive as possible of other cultures.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our idea is simple – two decks of cards with instructions which can be distributed from front line services- such as the NHS Memory Service and Admiral Nurses in the UK. To maximise our reach we will partner with charity organisations (e.g. Alzheimer Society UK) to spread awareness. As models of dementia care develop from residential to home care- we believe we have a role to play- eg. services which train informal care givers to care for their loved ones in their own home- would benefit from it</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The statements chosen for our cards are the result of our conversations with relatives and care givers and relevant to both the care-giver and care-recipient. A card game as it is an inexpensive way of promoting vital conversations- as well as being a familiar activity (playing cards) to most people. We are exploring the possibility of an online version as well as testing across different countries. Our early conversations give us confidence that the game can be translated and localised.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>0-3 months</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>We would aim to pilot the tool and hold focus groups with participants to receive feedback. We would like to measure “sense of confidence” about the future before and after using the cards. We would also like to know what actions have come from having the conversations promoted by the cards- as well as whether people would recommend the game to others.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment might you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We will be testing our idea with the family caregivers and mental health nurses we interviewed during our research phase. We will also be testing the idea with a professor who has over 25 years experience in dementia care and is internationally recognised for his authority on dementia care practice and policy.Secondly- we would like to test the idea with care homes in Spain- New Zealand and Australia (to test the idea cross-culturally) and local community groups working with elderly people.</p><h4>Who is your idea designed for and how does it better support family caregivers as they care for a loved one with dementia?</h4><p>The idea is designed for both- family caregivers and their loved ones at the early stages of being diagnosed withdementia- to support a meaningful conversation about what really matters - to them- as individuals and together.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","5","Dissemination channels have already been well thought out.","It would ease conversations between caregivers, family members, and patients.","This uses existing technology in order to carry out the idea.","5","5","5"

Isolation can be a major driver that increases the effects of dementia.We are working on a digital solution to keep them connected with their families and loved ones</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Conpago will continue to refine the Companion in order to give end users the best experience possible. We will look continue to look for funding so that we can push this product to the international market. Conpago aims to alleviate the burdens that caregivers have by implementing any new innovations that appear in the world of tech- whilst ensuring people with dementia maintain a good standard of living by allowing them to have as much independence for as long as possible.</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>Our ever expanding team has an array of experience from health and fitness- software engineering- user experience- business and design. We all share a passion for innovation and problem solving. We work closely with professionals from the aged care sector find their sore points and create solutions.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We see OpenIDEO as a great platform to bring to light many of the issues faced by this community- and in doing so- provide a network of like minded people to help create solutions- enable aging in place- and break down the stigma of aging.The greater community will see long term benefits as well- with a load taken off healthcare systems and aged care providers as the solutions created off the back of this program begin to alleviate people's dependence- and provides them with autonomy</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>The Conpago Companion will have corresponding apps downloadable on any iOS or Android device- allowing any number of caregivers or family members to interact with the dementia patient. This device can be effective for caregivers with loved ones at an early stage of dementia- allowing for ageing in place through the device's passive monitoring ability.

But they are scattered and care givers are overwhelmed. This system would have you put in all your information (for example- location and assets effect what services you can obtain)- aggregates the data and puts together a road map for everything you qualify for and templates to implement the care.

First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Get our program off the ground at USC!</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model.

First- it expands care access- reducing rates of caregiver depression. Second- its' integrated memory care allows seniors to slow their cognitive decline. Third- it creates a lasting impression on young minds as they decide which careers to pursue.</p><h4>What are your immediate next steps after the Challenge?</h4><p>Get our program off the ground at USC!</p><h4>Tell us about your work experience:</h4><p>In 2015- I founded The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA). Since then- YMAA has become the nation's widest-reaching nonprofit in providing opportunities for students to advocate- research- and volunteer in this field. I also am a biomedical researcher / seeking a BA in Computer Science.</p><h4>What skills- input- or guidance from the OpenIDEO community would be most helpful in building out or refining your idea?</h4><p>We can further our current progress under the guidance of the OpenIDEO team in refining and polishing our curricula and in making our model more human-centered. We hope to leverage experts within the network to create a more efficient- scalable- and sustainable model. Finally- we hope to benefit from OpenIDEO’s global network- with which we can exchange insights/ideas and spread the word about our venture.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate or plan to demonstrate scalability?</h4><p>Our program can work at any suburban or urban university. We plan- by year two- to be expansive in the LA area- but then move past this region into other urban cities- and finally into suburban areas.</p><h4>How does your idea demonstrate our Criteria of Accessibility?</h4><p>The fee for our program will be paid by the Caregiver. We believe this meets the Criteria of Accessibility because we are offering the care at the lowest cost on the market- hence opening up access to care for individuals who couldn't previously afford it. In addition- our program attracts a new niche in the respite market by providing care only 6 hours a week. Our market research shows this hour/week count is in high demand.</p><h4>How long has your idea existed?</h4><p>4 months - 1 year</p><h4>How do you plan to measure the impact of your idea?</h4><p>For quality measures- we will continue to assess our social impact through entrance and exit surveys – like we have done in our grant-funded model. We will give these surveys to students- caregivers- and PWDs.

Appthereby provides the opportunity for the caregiver to have more quality time with their loved one or for themselves.</p><h4>This idea emerged from</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>","5","if the app works as described it should be viable","this seems like a normal tracking app except that it has aspects that will benefit dementia patients especially","it seems like a lot of research has been done and that the developers know how to distribute it","4","4","4"
