 Encouraging communities to thrive with their own on-hand resources through a peer lending trust system.  1. communities with on-hand resources seeking financial empowerment; 2. individuals with savings looking for a alternative way to invest (lend) their money.  This idea takes advantage of the dynamics in a community (i.e. trust- organization- cooperation) to make it an attractive alternative investment solution for individual around the world. In turn- communities have access to a new financial resources (the savings of individuals).  Before launching any such platform- it is essential to test it on a micro-scale. Essentially- that means seeking out a local community with an on-hand resource looking for financial empowerment as well as a potential investor eager to help through investing. Testing the platform on a personal basis by word of mouth before launching it online is important. Discussing and getting feedback from the main players can insure a more successful system in the long run.  How to improve the educational sector of my idea? What about the mediator/facilitators from the community- does that seem to have success? How to perfect and gap the holes in the idea?  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Simple community banking where everyone benefits and is primarily focused on providing financial services for those who need it most.  First and foremost- the solution benefits those who are unable to access traditional banking accounts and services. Secondly- it benefits those who support such people to have better access to financial services (e.g.- the donors)- giving them knowledge that they are able to help fellow members of the community. It also allows such people to donate time in kind to staff with their ‘mobile’ banks. It also provides a forum for banks to support their local communities (and their CSR obligations).  As per the description above- it’s the power of the community that propels the network.  The solution can be built to start small: •A community bank (Bendigo Bank- Sydney AU) can be approached about diverting a percentage of its community funding to subsidise the cost of accounts and micro loans for a few people – a simple product with no charges or interest •Once successful- ‘traditional’ banking customers can directly donate money through a ‘keep the change’ approach •As a parallel activity of bringing the bank to the at-risk community members can be rolled out at any point  Further insights and resources to aid in the refinement and implementation of the solution.

 Use under utilized capacity/resources in the service industry to facilitate growth of community-based micro-entrepreneurs.  Well-equipped kitchens and spaces go unused every day in NYC when restaurants close on certain days of the week. Meanwhile- there are a number of people selling homemade food items on the streets (i.e. tamales). If these micro-entrepreneurs can get access to use these unused spaces- they can grow their own output/profit- while restaurants can be paid for the space use through a profit/product share- gain community respect- & possibly incentivize workers to stay employed (if family works there).  There would really leverage the core of the neighborhood -- neighbors giving each other a hand up. While logistical boundaries exist- this could blossom within the new sharing economy. This is an opportunity to create bridges between different ethnicities/cultures/communities- connecting restaurants to grow profits and expand menus- while educating individuals on growing a business. University students/city agencies could get involved -- developing business & financial planning skills.  We'd have to go out and talk to both restaurants and the micro-entrepreneurs- and determine the boundaries of the businesses (time- resources- etc) as well as the interest of the mirco-entrepreneurs.

 Education through a tiered approach enabling children to gain financial stability.  We wanted to develop a life-centered solution to improve the quality of life for the children- 10 to 15 years old- of Rio de Janeiro's Favelas- specifically Favela Rocinha. With this idea we will help teach children financial responsibility- help them develop resource management skills and empower them to play a part in the transformation of their community into prosperous neighborhoods.  People in Brazil's Favelas already have an entrepreneurial spirit with in their communities. We want to encourage this community infrastructure and build from it. We will also engage the community with the promotion and distribution of the program.  We would set up a small scale prototype within one of the schools or neighborhood facilities.

 You change behavior over the long term.  We'll benefit every community stakeholder on every economic level. Making information transparent and connecting people will ultimately strengthen communities and local business- specifically financial services because they'll be able to gather realtime data they've never had access to before helping them development new services and programs geared to reach specific end users. We'll allow them a way to maintain a monthly dialog with users to help them stay on the path.  What the founder of Tactile Finance learned about the real estate and banking industries isn't even the half of it. I think real estate more than banking prefers it's customers with as little info as possible. Most real estate companies are more worried about their bottom line than building sustainable communities. They ignore the part of housing- residential rentals- where most low-middle incomers dwell. And where the most support is needed for property owners to reduce risk so capital flows.  I was able to discuss with a community bank- how they could get better and more info on renters from the property owners they finance. They only make multifamily loans and the gov't wants to make sure the funds are really improving communities. I did classes at the CHA on sustainable communities for a year and talked to countless owners renting to low income people on housing assistance vouchers. And I operated a property management company for 10 years- I understand how to help this market.  http://firstround.com/review/Dropboxs-Head-of-Design-on-the-Dawn-of-Personalized-Products/ I initially thought we had a ux designer but have discovered I was mistaken so I still need help there and also looking for a dynamic programmer. Both people need to design and program with an eye on where their industry is headed as much as where it is now. And both should have the ability to create on their own from a concept. Some only thrive when being given explicit direction- need free thinkers.  An individual ,0,0

 Grassroots level education through community leaders who will be provided with incentives for their performance and production.  There will be two main players in this project - the community and the ambassador. The community will be given financial access through the ambassadors and they can approach them with ease for any questions or concerns instead of going to somewhere or someone distant to the community. The ambassador will be given incentives for their performance as access points for the community - they can sell bank accounts and also serve as teachers for their community.  Through the ambassadors- the community members can easily open bank accounts for themselves and their families. Targeting areas with BanKO partner outlets or establishments- they can easily cash in and out of their accounts. They will be given access to different financial services such as cash in and out- purchase of airtime for a discounted rate- send money through their phones- pay utility bills- buy insurance- and apply for loans.  BanKO can perform a pilot test in 2 areas in Metro Manila- Philippines - Quezon City and Las Pinas City. The company is targeting those communities since parent leaders were already contacted and the areas are near the head office of the company. They can easily be reached for any updates and can be easily gathered for any orientation or refresher sessions.  BanKO is very open and willing to learn on how they can effectively educate the community leaders and members. Guidance in making the project more human-centered and more effective in replicating for different areas. OpenIDEO will definitely be able to refine and shape the goal and plans into something that can improve the lives ofthe Filipino people.  An organization ,0,0
 Create a platform that will enable financial awareness for children through neighborhood jobs  This idea will benefit the community but primarily younger generations who are asked to identify opportunities within a neighborhood and then negotiate a price for the job. They will learn to be creative- entrepreneurial and financially responsible as they will gain a better understanding into the effort required to obtain compensation. This platform could work in all locations and demographics. The jobs would vary but the education taken from the experience would be life changing.  Communities need a way for people to connect with one another beyond their immediate neighbors and offer up money making and financially educational opportunities to children or young adults so that they will learn these lessons earlier in life. The process would be to provide a platform for individuals to identify problems or jobs that are needed throughout the community. They would then approach the benefactor to negotiate a price for this service. From there the service could be provided.  Gather our neighbors together and discuss the platform concept. We could then encourage the young people to seek out opportunities and begin to negotiate the importance and price of the service. This would help us better understand the needs of the platform before setting out on designing the solution to help facilitate the interaction.  Feedback about how the solutions could be identified and captured. Testing the concept within different communities. Improving and iterations on the idea.  Other ,0,0
 Could reduction of pay inequality help build trust and subsequently empower those of lower economic class?  This idea could primarily benefit people who are disenfranchised by the current levels of income disparity (at least from a U.S. perspective).I do believe that everyone could potentially benefit from this idea.  By defining- and building- communities that include all economic classes I believe we can build trust (in both directions) between those who have financial knowledge and power and those who are more or less disenfranchised by current structures.  Ben & Jerry's is one example of a company that tried to limit the ratio in pay between the highest paid employee and the lowest- but unfortunately that practice didn't survive the sale of the company.Other than seeking out other examples- I have to acknowledge that I'm not sure of a lightweight test.  I think it would be important to try to quantify what would constitute an ideal amount of pay inequality and what the tradeoffs might be- if that can be done via appropriate research.I would also welcome ideas on how to facilitate building community and networks between high and low earners.

 Peer lending network offering a borrowing alternative for those who can't obtain conventional loans; program infrastructure provided by CUs.  This program would benefit individuals who cannot oftain a convential loan product from a bank /CU (perhaps due to lack of credit or poor credit). It would also benefit individual's who are interested in taking on more investment risk for a potentially higher yield. Finally- this programs could benefit CUs who would provide the program backbone (ensuring lending compliance- providing required documents- etc) as the CUs would realize a new revenue stream from the small service fees imposed.  Leverging the burgoening growd sourcing movement- this new platform would bring borrowers and investors together from accross the nation/world to provide the funds needed to those who may lack other alternatives. By creating a community where individuals can invest in each other and offer collateral or security that may be unconvential by traditional standards- it creates new opportunities for the underserved. Group funding helps spread the risk and increases the likelihood of a loan being made.  Surveying individuals on the likelihood of lending money to various individuals based on varying scenarios and circumstances. This would provide an opportunity to test potential investors appetite for risk and willingness to contribute varying amounts at varying interest yields. This could also provide an opportunity to test the impact that social currency of helping out someone in need has on individual's sense of accomplishment and resulting desire to contribute.  It takes a community to build a community so i'd seek the OpenIDEO community to provide feedback on what they would value most from such a program (as a borrower or investor). I would determine the value of social currency- poll users to get a feel for risk tolerance- acceptable collateral- what role the CU industry could play to create a secure and trustworthy community where transactions could occur.

 This is a social event empowering millennials with critical financial planning skills- tools/resources they otherwise do not have access to.  College students- grads w/ student debt- non-college both working & unemployed- those dependent onassistance &little to no retirement located select counties in Indiana.We'retargeting young adults to provide alternatives/preventative education for current/future struggles.They will have direct access to financial education- tools/resources- asset building- planning &support to establish long term financial security in a socially fun setting provided by Natco Credit Union.  Natco will kick this off with an “Amazing Race”community challenge.Participants will go to various small business/centers to complete a challenge then given a clue to continue to event. Challenges will include financial activities related to the event theme.At the venue- guest speakers willshare info. on debt/credit- home ownership- student loans- employment- retirement- investing- etc. These community business owners/experts agree to actively follow up with participants one on one post events  Natco Credit union will be seeking the assistance of a few millennial volunteers from our target market to assist in the planning and preparation of the weekly/monthly social events.We then willhost a Financial Happy Hour event to gauge the level of interest and to ensure that topics are on target and we are impacting our future community leaders. This will also provide opportunity to access marketing content such as pictures- reviews and create a social media buzz.  We have seen similar programs being offered abroad with solid turnout and positive outcomes.We seek assistance/support with the topic content- incentives-delivery/group engagement- interactive activity ideas with long term impact & any input that would contribute to the financial freedom of our attendees.There is nothing even close to this program in our area and we have many young adults who are lost and have no financial knowledge whatsoever.

 We will roll out a savings product for RMG workers and measure the impact of work-place networks on the decision to use this product.  RMG workers often choose to work in the sector for the purpose of meeting specific savings goals. We will partner with a local bank- to offer RMG workers a savings product known as a DPS (Deposit Premium Scheme). This allows them to commit to a savings amount on a monthly basis for a fixed tenure- which can overlap with their anticipated tenure in the RMG sector. Thus- when they go back to their home villages they would have either met their goals or accrued enough to meet their savings goals.  From poor accessibility to a bank- to a lack of products catered to the needs and income flows of the poor- there are many barriers to engaging with the formal financial sector. This affects their friends and family equally- resulting in a lack of knowledge on how and where to save. Hence- they are in need of reliable sources for financial advice. We try to solve this problem by using work place networks to measure the effect of peers- managers and high-performing peers on saving decisions.  The experiment will have two rounds. In the first round- we will offer the product to managers- high-performing workers and normal workers. In the second round- we will offer the product to workers under different information treatments. Some will learn of the take-up rates of managers- others peers or high-performing workers.A control group will be offered the product with no information and there will be also be a group that isn’t offered the product. Treatment assignment will be randomized.  We are looking to place this idea on a platform where it can grow and gain support in terms of design from ideas on how a similar product can be rolled out in other practical settings. We also hope to benefit from the networks within the OpenIDEO community to disseminate our findings so that it can be further refined and applied in alternate settings.  A group brainstorm ,0,0
 Creating affordable- agile- and empowering marketplace of learning community  4x3x2x1group encourages trust- focus and active participation by limiting number of participants- no of meetings and duration. The attendees will benefit from supportive- flexible- affordable- and personal learning program while the leader receive incentive- develop network- experience and skills. It allows the less fortunate to monetize skills they have much more easily. Such model can be more attractive for business and organization to sponsor given its measurable impacts.  Community Guideline is critical for a community to thrive. We propose new guideline that can be easily adopted in existing community structures- systems and values. The guideline brings recommended practices of effective group building through optimum number of participants- catalyze trust and bonding through repeat interactions- yet limit commitment needed. It incorporate money as incentives and create new financial opportunities by sharing skills - ultimately create new skill-based marketplace  A local meetups can be organized based on approaches mentioned above- featuring a mentor on basic financial management. The goal of the experiment is to invite- get participants to pay- attend all 3 sessions and satisfy the learning objectives.Some questions: - Should we pay at each session? as lump sum for all sessions at the beginning or at the end? - Should we make a bigger group with lower fees or small group with higher fees?- Should we use money or tokens?  The idea needs inputs especially from those who have experience as facilitator and helping out those with financial challenges. What works? What doesn't? How can we communicate the group / community rules better? What bite-sized financial management topics that is relevant? What guidelines can be provided for group leader to organize and facilitate meetups successfully?  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Find people in your community to enlarge your buying power and save  In a community there are people who need the same products at the same point of time. Why couldn't they get together to buy more- share this and safe money instead? This idea is targeting families and singles who are frequent internet shoppers.  A community's power is stronger than the sum of each individual. This can also be related to the power of the customers against suppliers. A community would be able to get cheaper prices for groceries- clothes and other commodities buy collecting their demand and forcing the suppliers to lower the price.  Collect the demand of notebooks at the beginning of a new semester in my students club and get the cheapest price online. See how much you can share and which commodities can be purchased via this approach. The experiment could be enlarged by saving demand for an order of new clothes when seasons change.  Do you think collecting the demand and scheduling the orders will work via an app? How could the community search for the cheapest offers?  An individual ,0,0
 The ideal app would present data in the right context- structure incentives to encourage positive behavior- and enable social interactions.  Anyone that uses a smartphone and is interested in opportunities for more successful financial management could engage with this tool. Access to traditional financial services is not a requirement; the app can help manage spending for anyone that users payment systems that are connected digitally - traditional banks- Paypal- digital currencies- etc.  A key element of this tool is the ability to use community benchmarks to better understand spending patterns- and share spending/saving behaviors with others in your network. We believe that opportunities to make anonymous comparisons with other people in similar situations and share positive financial behaviors openly within your network spread knowledge and encourage positive decisions.  There are opportunities to test the contextually relevant budget capability using a behavioral test at a local grocery store - participants would be presented with budget information and details on their past spending as they enter the store- and a follow-up interview would assess the impact on their spending. Similar small prototypes could be created to test the impact of personalized rewards (iTunes/Netflix) on weekly spending as well as benefits associated with social budgeting/benchmarking.  It would be great to receive input across a few key questions - What causes individuals to loose track of their budget?- What are locations when it would be helpful to receive advice/information about your spending?- What are other incentives beyond iTunes/Netflix that users would want to receive daily/weekly/monthly as a reward for positive spending behavior?

 How might we promote financial literacy throughout a comic book?  Mostly- children- teenagers who are interested in comic books and its storytelling format.  A comic book can be used in schools by teachers for a playful teaching method- read by children by themselves- be adapted to digital channels.

 Using financials and community expertise to easier handle the most important products.  The idea is to handle the most important products for living or production with network of experts to facilitate a more efficient use of the highest spendings. The fourth highest expenses worldwide are spend at the moment for transport- for example. The group would take the most important category within the city or region and build up a expert network- providing clients with datas for this product and even build up a concept for this segment.  The idea is not centered on abilities- but on spending experiences and community expertise. The network of producers and shop owners can narrow the spendings for a category down and with financial support from sponsors even beyond the usual spendings. A lot of expenses are not structured- for example when I analyse that during one year most of the expenses for traffic happen because of a defect part. The idea would be to analyse and then using the community to act better and fairer.  Companies- shop owners and production facilites can be asked what they are able to provide. Production facilites can provide parts- shop owners special services and the team must solve the problem- how such a small ecosystem could raise the necessary attention- stay attractive as well as financial able to guarantee a good service.  I am interested if a similar project already exist- for example for a single product or category and what other transaction methods can be used for such an idea.  An individual ,0,0
 First-generation college alumni can help counsel 1st gen college students and help them avoid financial pitfalls (updated 6/2/15)  Mid-20 to mid-30s 1st generation college alumni could work with current 1st gen students- counseling them through what is often a difficult transition that is poorly understood by those who haven't gone through it.  For almost every college- there is a group of dedicated college alumni who donate to the college- interview perspective students- and are willing to talk with students about their careers. Those alumni who experienced the difficulties of being first generation college students would likely be willing to reach out to first generation students now- to help them manage the tribulations- temptations- and expense of college life.  As a 1st gen alum living near my alma mater (and now in business school there)- I will talk to my university about the potential of this idea.  An individual ,0,1
 Please respond to our user needs survey - https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JZRWF2QMaking the small print legible- accessible and engaging.  Increasing financial literacy for loans at the point of purchase by making financial terms and their consequences really clear- accessible and engaging.Primarily focused on unsecured loans with high interest rates (pay day loans- credit cards- pawning agreements- credit to purchase goods or services (like those offered by some electronic / furniture shops- car companies and builders)).  Using crowdsourcing mechanisms to help connect people who want to know what the financial implications of taking a loan will be with a community of experts who can clearly communicate that cost.  Prototyping Need: Sitting down with someone who might take out a high interest loan to explore (1) their decision making process regarding the loan; and (2) pain points relating to understanding the consequences that fall out of a financial contract. Prototyping translators: Creating a video pitching the idea at the people who would help translate the contracts and see how they react to the idea.  Poke holes in the idea- tell me what's working and what isn't.Share your experiences around interpreting financial contracts - what was difficult- what was easy- did you pay much attention to the terms- have any terms bitten you later on?

 Combining a financial tool with integrated information- allowing the user to find answers to questions as they come.  This idea could benefit anyone with savings that wants to be better informed about how to manage their money. Once you start doing some research about where to place your savings you realize you have to be concerned about inflation- high fees- interest rates- etc. Automated investment services such as Betterment offer an easier way to invest- but these tools are not entirely transparent. This idea is for savers who want to build some basic financial skills but don't know where to begin.  Today- robo-advisors supply online investment management and financial advice through desktop platforms and mobile apps. This idea is leveraging the infrastructure of this existing system- using it as a medium to incite intrigue and furnish detailed information explaining metrics and jargon.  Lightweight prototypes could be made using spreadsheet programs such as Excel or Numbers. The success and presence of current tools; for example- automated investment services or robo-advisors such as Betterment and Wealthfront- is an indicator of the potential for this idea. Both founded in 2008- Betterment currently controls $1.4 billion in client assets while Wealthfront has $2 billion in assets under management.

 Creating a social card & account linked to a network of community funds & projects within my bank to facilitate social funding & development  The idea creates a network within the existing financial system through a community bank as part of an existing bank- that includes accounts for NGOs- local & global community projects- citizens looking for loans and small initiatives as well as bank members willing to contribute financially. In addition- the bank members will get a debit card for their social accounts to facilitate donating and create a simplified connection to those needing funds within the current system & community.  Members of the community are often encouraged to do good by seeing others do so. The idea is to give social community hubs- such as cafes- libraries- stores etc. accounts in the community bank or connect them back to the network so as to use them as an outlet for people to use the social card. While buying a coffee- they can use their card to quickly donate to any of the projects registered at the bank. Meanwhile- allowing others to see a simplified way of contributing within their own community  A simple way is to create a sample of the social card and start using it within local community hubs and introduce it to the community. Thereby- you can test the communities reaction to the idea and their willingness to become part of the network whether as donor or receiver. It is also essential to test the banks willingness to set up such a network within their system- though it will not require their financial contribution- but merely their management.  The idea allows for a lot of creative development and assessment. This includes ideas such as cafes creating their own account for people to put in money for free coffee for homeless people etc. It will also require input and further development as to how to integrate it within the financial system and back to the community.

 Property owners providing free short term accommodation to those in need (e.g. victims of domestic violence) through channels like Airbnb.  Existing property owners who already rent out part or all of their property could provide accommodation for free- as a form of (tax deductible?) donation to individuals and families needing short term accomodation and support following a personal/financial crises. This provides people with 'breathing space' in a safe environment to work out their financials and 'where to from here'.  This taps into existing communities on site like Airbnb- private rental and couchsurfing sites. It focuses on close geographical communities (i.e. housing people from your own city) and could involve some kind of matching system so that property owners could support people of similar age- who have had a similar crises in the past etc. It could also be facilitated by charities/housing services to reduce risk and increase safety of both parties.  Airbnb already offers something like this in the USA for people post a large natural disaster (e.g. Hurricane Sandy). This could be expanded to other countries and other accommodation sites.  Input from people using sites like Airbnb as either a guest or a property owner. Input from people working at charities that require housing options for clients (e.g. charities dealing with domestic violence- new migrants- homelessness).

 Transformation from downward spiral of debt trap to upward path of financial inclusion using data analysis  At the core of it- the idea benefits MSMEs (ex: small holder farmer in Indonesia - referred as Taman) in emerging markets. Taman is farmer in Indonesia who does not have access to credit. But it will also create value for financial institutions (MFIs and Commercial Banks) and the Government. MSMEs will get loans and saving tools faster- easier and cheaper. Profitability of MFIs would be improved up to 5 times and the Government will be able to meet development targets.  TRUST- is a major adoption barrier in the whole process. and close second is education. The idea will use informal networks of the community- informal data exchanged in the community and the existing trust between community member to develop and deliver the solution. Consider small holder farmers in Indonesia- they have community based solutions for agri-info and financial support. But there are ways to improve existing model to achieve scale and impact using data present in current model.  An application prototype would be build to deliver on envisioned experience map for accessing financial services. This app would be used to help each stakeholder experience the solution. Farmers will be asked to give information required for solution and key assumption can be tested. The feedback would be incorporated to refine it further leading to a product tailored to specific needs. Providing The existing users of current model can be provided services to test the efficacy of the solution.  I believe the solution to promote financial inclusion varies by community. There are a lot of informal models to doing daily activities that vary from community to community. Communities within a country are closely linked- but again vary by current work industry. A better understanding of the needs of farmers and MFIs would in refining the solution further.  An individual ,0,0
 See your old age nest egg grow  This idea benefits the low income people who do not have enough disposable income to save for old age  There should be a law mandating 8% payment to a pension account for every payment you make to a person not covered by a pension plan but forward thinking communities can implement this in their communities without waiting for a law  We can take one ward in Delhi out of 272 and see what people think of the idea and how many individuals who use domestic help and how many businesses who have employees not covered by pension- pay the 8% pension.  Is this idea unique or has this been done elsewhere. If it has been done elsewhere examples will help adoption in Delhi.  An individual ,0,0
 Financial literacy changes as you become more empowered  It benefits those who seek to improve financial literacy and those who receive financial literacy training  In every community there are early adopters who will learn quickly as long as the learning is immediately relevant and delivered in easily digestible doses. They will then teach their friends  Our hypothesis is that poor households have gotJan Dhan bank accounts(J)- Aadhar cards (A)and most of them have mobile phones (M). This is called the JAM trinity in India.They now need to get the mobile phone linked to their account- get alerts and an MMID number. They need tolearn to use their debit cards at an ATM. We may test this soon in one of 272 wards in Delhi. This will enable them to receive money directly into their accounts. We will then get govt benefits/wages credited directly  Has a similar easy step approach been used anywhere else . If it has worked and is documented then it would be great if links could be provided or documents uploaded.  A group brainstorm ,0,0
 Each student would receive a salary based on performance- participation- and other school credentials to use for lunch and school store.  This idea benefits the world because if young kids are educated about how to spend their money; they directly impact the future of our economy. The users would be parents- teachers- school employees- and the students- of course. This is targeting kids from K to 5th grade. The teachers would have to plan a system on the salary for each student and what are the factors that play into it. I think we could start in the public schools in Chicago or another big public school network.  This idea is leveraging the family communities in big cities to bring together their kids- teachers- and parents. Usually kids learn about handling money in high school and by that point- it is too late because there will always be a divide in the financial health of each household. By learning the value of a dollar early on- the kids will gain insight on how to spend their money- what their needs are vs. their wants- and how to treat others equally.  I could go to my old middle school or elementary school and try to test this idea out in one class. I could work with the teacher and the parents to come up with a salary system. Then the kids could just buy things during class and then we came move further to lunch or the school store.  I need help to come up with a structured plan around this idea. When I was younger- I went to a children's museum in Chicago where there was a fake grocery store and I could pick out the things I wanted and go to the cashier. I had a limit based on the fake money I had. I want to emulate the same kind of experience every day for kids because it made the experience of money super fun!!  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Social Platform for Non-Governmental Organizations  Doar would benefit people who participate of the donation process. The Non-governmental organization (NGO) have to be funded by donations- and sometimes this is not a financial process. Because of this- they receive different types of products- and possibly these products don’t fulfill their needs in that time. In this sense- Doar will be a platform that could help the communication between this two parts and this process.  Donation is a process that helps many people around the world to have a decent life. With Doar this process will be easier. As an example- according to Instituto Comunitario da Grande Florianopolis (ICom)- only in my city Florianopolis- SC/Brazil are more than two hundreds unities of NGO’s. With DOAR in this community- the donation process would be easier and more financially efficient for these organizations.  I could apply this project in Florianopolis- SC/Brazil- because the donation scene is really big. Furthermore- I could enter in contact with the NGO’s inviting them to participate of the project- showing the importance of the platform. As well- I could do a connection with the contributors- such as big companies of the region and philanthropists. Once this project was implemented in a city- will be easier to open for different locations and countries.  The community of OpenIDEO could help with the ideation of new features and feedbacks. Also- the development of the digital platform could be a really good help!  An individual ,0,0
 Make it easy for those with lower income to invest money for long term benefits.  This idea generated from an article I read about the worth of the black woman. I was startled to know how many of us were not worth $5.However- for those that are in the lower level income bracket it becomes more crucial a task.So the demographics start with women who are making a living or less than a living wage and are still responsible for children.  There are 1000s of organizations created to help women with getting jobs- financial literacy- and other issues that affect their lives.My approach is to teach them about savings and create a financial mechanism that will help them see the value of saving. The amount that I will ask for is $5.If I can reach 1-000-000 of us and show how $5 can grow I can inspire others to do the same. What I need is a mutual fund or bank that can help me run the program.  Once I had the financial partner in place- I would be able to start with the Washington DC Metropolitan area with 100 women who are willing to invest in the fund. We would meet monthly- like an investment club- and watch the money grow.  First- I need a financial partner who can advise me on creating the savings fund I envision. I would love to have partners who focus on women opportunities who can help me reach out to women and share the $5 Dollar Project.Everyone who believes in the idea is valuable as it could really change lives.

 Embed playgrounds with geometry lessons as a catalyst for independent thinking and empowerment  Integrating geometric concepts into the design of playgrounds will produce a tangible and localized catalyst for learning. This idea assumes that we empower communities where education and financial independence remain stagnant. Young children may see the playground in one way as they play. Teenagers may model it with class geometry topics (flexible). Learning in an environment normally intended for play will help to make math concepts fun- relatable and transferable to other endeavors.  The idea maintains focus on the design of ‘learning playgrounds.’ It also strives to create dexterity and engagement with a space- its learning and the community. For example- returning students could share their knowledge by explaining to younger kids how ‘learning playgrounds’ can and may have been applied in real life. Local communities could host class projects where students would be responsible for adding design features- class lessons or projects with the playground and its space etc.  Kids familiar with geometry (grades 8-12) could be divided into groups. Each group would be given a limited amount of fluorescent colored duct tape. The exercise requires each group to build at least 4 different shapes on the playground. However- each shape can only be made with one color of tape. This exercise promotes critical thinking about space- resources- collaboration and the need to trade equal amounts of tape between groups in order to complete the assignment. (Hand outs encouraged)  Child and learning development expertise. Other applications of the idea. Alternative materials. Playground designers. Risks or limitations associated with the exercise.

 Napkin Finance is a visual- engaging- and fun guide to learning about money and finance.  Our mission is to help millennials and young adults make smart money decisions. We have developed Napkin Finance as a quick and easy resource on everything you need to know about money in 30 seconds or less. It teaches readers how to take ownership of their personal finances and understand the power and impact behind making informed money decisions.Our platform helps organizations and financial institutions create a lifetime of financial well-being for their members and customers.  Learning about finance can be intimidating and oftentimes overwhelming. The opportunity to create a lifetime of financial success is limited by the lack of access and skills.We partner with organizations that are working with young adults that may never otherwise have access to financial education. Napkin Finance has become a community of ideas and concepts that empowers readers to fully understand the complexity of personal finance.  The Napkin Finance platform is simple and easy to understand- administer- and distribute. It can be tested in schools and with organizations that are working with young adults.We hope to evaluate the effectiveness of our finance literacy program on different age groups and skill sets.We are also working on a more interactive napkin with videos and clickable images.  We are working with specialists and experts in various fields to develop our curriculum and content.From the OpenIDEO community- we would love feedback on the design- clarity- and usefulness of our current program.We would also welcome suggestions for additional topics and categories and how to make the platform more engaging.

 Teaching financial literacy in terms that a person can relate to  Most of us do not study finance and let's face it- it can be tedious and boring to look these terms up or try learning about them. I think this idea can benefit people who don't want to spend much time or energy trying to be a finance literate. This will make learning financial literacy fun!!  Each of us have an obsession or weakness for something. For some it is shoes- for some it is gadgets or books etc. How about which translate all the financial terms into those terms. Say- Person A likes to buy a lot of shoes. So we translate terms like funds- savings- investing - learning how money works in terms of number shoes he/she can buy or is equal to.A mobile application can be built to do this. This would make the entire process fun.  An individual ,0,0
 Cell phone access by answering financial literacy questions.  The target market would be the young adults (age 14-20) that are entering into the “real” financial world. The immediate benefit of the plan is to give access to using a cell phone based on correctly answering a finance question. Long term the knowledge gained through the learning games will provide for better financial understanding.  Local financial institutions can provide incentives to active accounts within their Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The community financial institutions that work with app development as financial sponsors are benefiting as well by gaining access to new clientele that are financially savvy.  Focus group in a local school with students and parents would provide for proof of concept.  Phone app development would be the most helpful. The development of the User Interface (UI) is a bit beyond me- but I can provide basis for financial questions.  Other ,0,0
 Create an automatic savings service on the internet- allowing families to prepare for the future of their children.  This idea will benefit not only those who seek to save funds to secure their children's future- but can also be applied to banking and trading partners.  This idea challenge is to create a solution where existing communities help families plan and take responsibility for investing into their future. The service is based on a societal idea of the reconciliation of consumption and savings; by offering an automatic and painless child savings solution. The final goal is to invite all family members to join the service and create real intergenerational solidarity.  Interview families and different house holds of various backgrounds- and also the business sector- including banks and companies- to gauge their level of interest in such a partnership.

 Philanthropy driven by those who receive funds.  This idea will benefit grantees and the constituents they serve. Ultimately the grantee will be the active participant in the proposed structure- acting on behalf of their mission and who they serve.  If the recipient of funding can help to determine funding design- type- recipients- and amounts- the philanthropic deployment of funds will more effectively leverage transformation. The community will be the grantor and the involvement of grantee leaders will create more interconnectedness within the impact sector.  There have been applications of this model through a process called Shared Gifting. This process has been in application on a smaller scale for decades. More here: http://rsfsocialfinance.org/shared-gifting/  The barriers to creating this model on a larger scale is buy in from funders- likely foundations. The funding sources have their priorities and directives but if the paradigm can shift to one which releases direction of granting to the community- access to capital could stand to benefit from a more inclusive process. Granting is a standard process to the majority - those with funds decide where funds go (even if based on research or experiment). It will be hard to change this paradigm.  An organization ,0,0
 Using our kids to help our communities from an early age  This idea will benefit both parents and children. From an early age- parents can teach their children about the importance of money and helping others by implementing some rules in their households. For example- if their kids misbehaved in day core/school- the parents take away their treats and save it for the kids that are poor. This way the kids behave- parents help out another family in need.  Parents can share their household rules with neighbors and families. The family may decide to adopt the same rule for their family or similar ones. The end game is to teach their kids that there is poor families out there that needs support and parents can contribute to another family's need without having to take money out of their budget. When the children comes to the age of having a piggy bank- they can discipline them by taking $1 out every time they misbehave.  An individual ,0,0
 Give each beneficiary of food banks $10 and give them food each time after that only when they reproduce the $10.  This idea benefits the 46.5 million people who use the service provided by Feeding America. The whole idea is to teach them to be financially independent thus eventually reducing the number of people depending on food banks. The beneficiaries can multiply the money using ideas around financial literacy which can be taught through various media such as flyers- camps- programs- etc.  The disadvantaged demographic uses the Feeding America network on a regular basis to fulfill their food requirements. Each community can raise the funds needed to support this program so that the government does not have to bear the costs of running this initiative. The community can also help provide options to the disadvantaged people on how to multiply the $10 that they will receive.  We can pilot this program in a single food bank to understand the feasibility of this project. Providing $10 to each individual who uses that food bank service and check whether they are utilizing the $10 to multiply the same. We can choose the bank that has a tight-knit community that supports the bank so that we can help more people to become financially sustainable.  It will be interesting for me to know whether anyone in this community has tried something similar. I would also like to get suggestions around using money as a tool to foster accountability. Currently food banks provide food for free- but do you think giving money first and asking an individual to just retain the money over a period of time can teach her financial literacy?

 Keep your digital pet alive by saving money!  This idea can assist many communities- from kids learning the importance of saving money for a rainy day or adults with bad financial habits. This concept allows for users to sympathize with their digital pets needs. The more you save the better healthier your pet will be.  Our challenge focus on digital communities- we plan to focus our efforts on digital tacking- forums and comparisons. If your family is saving for a vacation- you can create a family pet. See who contributes more - the competitive nature might nourish some unexpected results.  OpenIDEO Chicago would test a variety of user groups to see who is the best target market- as of know we know that kids enjoy and become addicted to games quickly. However with some thought- we also realize that teens and adults greatly enjoy games such as angry birds. Could we streamline the experience to fit a variety of folks. Make it harder to keep you pet alive as you grow older and make more money.  We would love for ideas and observations from the openIDEO community. What challenges could we set in place to make the game more interesting - can we link the app to peoples bank and credit accounts?  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Allowing those with the financial knowledge to share it with those who need it!  It would benefit the immediate community these programs are located in. The main players are volunteers who would spend their time educating others of the concepts of financial responsibility. For example- they could go to high schools or community halls once a week to share their experiences- presenting real life examples rather than conceptual math classes. The volunteers would benefit because by teaching others- they would understand the material better as well as obtain new perspectives.  The majority of the volunteers are ideally university students or professors (who are willing to dedicate their time to help others.) This may create a tighter network as each 'teacher' is trying to help someone in his/her community directly. In the long run- those who were initially learning could go on to become volunteers themselves in order to give back to their community- therefore creating a cycle that is constantly changing and evolving.  Generation Citizen- a similar project in which volunteers go to local high schools to teach students about making a change in their community has seen some success in the east coast. Their core structure could act as a resource and a model that this new concept could follow. With GC's success in major cities such as Boston & Philadelphia- it does seem viable to assume that this concept could grow in big cities as well.  It would be a great starting point if OpenIDEO could provide its network for the project. The first step would be to market what the project is and how it would work. Having a strong network will go a long way with a) getting the message to the public- b) obtaining the volunteers and gauging interest- and c) calculating if the project is feasible on a financial basis.

 Harness the Entrepreneurial activities of the community to build it.  This idea benefits the direct community as a whole- which could potentially bring them together to help build- the players are the community.  This idea would see communities build their wealth- infrastructure etc. together. By being able to directly contribute- whether it be through money- time- manual labour or materials and then harnessing the ideas each community has to improve their local areas. This would assist in building much needed basic resources- which in turn would allow the community to concentrate on other areas for furtherdevelopment.  I think this is already a work in practice for certain communities- for example the Amish- from my basic understanding they are essentially a self sufficient community that grow and build resources together.  The flaw I can see in this idea is the politics surrounding the appropriation of funds and being able to minimize corruption. How could we bring a democratic or fair ideology into countries that do not follow this culture?  An individual ,0,0
 When women are financially empowered- the whole community wins.  This idea not only helps to transform the traditional attitudes among women but also do benefits to the whole society once women could become economic independent.The main player here is the dominance of the women in econmic position.  When the women become economic independent- the whole communities could create more work opportunies - resources- and even develop quickly.  In Chinese history- the position of women might be lower than men's as the traditional attitudes towards economic independence. However- the perspectives have changed graduallyandwomen become more and more independent especially in the economic aspect even some women may be more powerful in the economic position than men. And the whole society develops quite dramatically with the financial independence of women. Therefore- I think this could be helpful to the community in any other counties.  change traditional attitudes between men and women in financial position could be the key to arrange this thoughts.

 Community endowments create wealth from investments in which profit is distributed to local shareholders and philanthropic organizations.  Community endowments benefit three core users: businesses- non-profits- and individuals. The investment arm of a community endowment creates wealth through investment and support for local businesses. Profit from the investment activity is distributed as a dividend to shareholders who then spend this money in the local economy. Lastly- the other portion of profit is granted to non-profits which through their work raise community aura- thus circling back to benefit businesses and individuals.  The community endowment concept draws on existing institutions; however- the novelty is in pairing an investment group- a co-operative mutual fund- and a community foundation under a single partnership. Instead of wealth concentrating in the hands of a few- it's distributed to residents interested in becoming a shareholder. This creates not only supplementary income but also a sense of ownership and pride in community.  Create a small experimental group of ten to twenty friends willing to invest $50 into a co-operative mutual fund or credit union like structure. Then- invest the sum amount in a local business through a low interest bearing micro-loan. Take the profits and distribute a portion to the shareholders and then the remainder to a non-profit that supports community and economic development. See how the non-profit's actions might have benefited either the business- shareholders- or both!  There is potential for this idea but many obstacles as well. The early obstacles are establishing a legal structure and ensuring the protection and stewardship of the shareholders' investment. Secondly- how can consistent profitability be generated so that shareholders receive a dividend? What can non-profits do to ensure their work is felt by businesses and citizens?  An individual ,0,0
 Financial advisors are often too expensive for those most in need of their services. Let's connect community members with students!  This idea benefits those in need and students studying financing. Those in need can receive financial advice at a considerable lower rate than what they might pay a financial advisor. College students can charge a small fee and benefit from the real world experience of advising their community members.  This idea connects those who have deep financial knowledge with those who don't. It empowers the community by making financial guidance more accessible and empowers those in school by helping them refine their expertise.  We could see how willing community members might be to receive financial advice from college students and how willing student might be to refine their expertise in the real world. We could also explore price points/subscription models that are acceptable by all involved.  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Socially but anonymously talk about financial matters you might otherwise keep hidden.  This idea benefits people who might be too embarrassed to speak about their financial situation with others. It gives them a social platform to voice their concerns while remaining anonymous. Each person would write their money issue on a mask and wear it at the event. Money Masquerades would be led by financial advisors who would consult and moderate open conversations between people. At the end of the event- people could optionally reveal their true selves—there's nothing to hide- afterall.  Money Masquerades make public otherwise private financial conversations- drawing on the power of people to address money questions and curiosities.  We could host our own Money Masquerade and test what types of people are interested in attending and what information they might be willing to share with others.  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 The dollar sign is often used to connote price: the more $s- the bigger the price tag. Let's rethink how we communicate value and costs.  This idea benefits all shoppers and service providers. Similar to movie ratings that have guidelines enforcing their correct application- the dollar sign- from $-$$$$ (or perhaps we create new icons) could more expressively differentiate products and services based on their true cost and value. Shoppers can make smarter purchasing decisions when they understand why something costs what it does and what value it has. Services can better differentiate their offerings beyond price point.  Film ratings influence movie releases and audience attraction which influences film production by movie houses. An audience's reaction to a simple but differentiating PG or R rating can determine what is bought into and what isn't. Leveraging communities in a similar fashion by making the $ a greater symbol of service/product cost and value not only better helps people understand the true quality of what they are buying- it could also shape that quality over time.  We could speak with community members to gain a greater understanding of what $- $$- $$$- and $$$$ means to people. We could also explore different icons to see what visual cues communicate cost and value best.  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 A non-profit 'Re.looks' @ decline factors & puts would-be borrowers on a 30- 60- 90 or 180 day track to being able to re-apply successfully.  This target audience is people who have been declined for a loan & are: Already engaged with the credit union & possibly a member Motivated to learn behavior that will put them in position to borrow Need something the credit union has (a loan)This solution makes CU impact on several levels: This is in keeping with a core value of the CU industry – to educate and enrich. CUs are able to turn declines into borrowers increasing profitability Impact can be measured definitively  The credit union community is made up of 6400 CUs and 98 million members. The industry generates hundreds of declines for loan applications (mortgage- auto and unsecured) daily. Currently our community is offering a free credit report to declined would-be borrowers- but not much more. The end user for this idea (the would-be borrower) is arguably a person who needs financial education the most- is coming to the CU community for a solution.  I lead a team of financial literacy specialists at Patelco Credit Union (one of the larger CUs in the US). Our team has begun connection with members who have been declined for loans to learn if this is an idea that might benefit them. The response is an overwhelming 'yes!'

 An app allowing parents to track their little sprouts financial literacy milestones - is my child on track? The app grows with your sprout  This will help parents and children alike track their financial milestones - much like an app to ensure your child is accomplishing all of their developmental milestones. This app will allow users to keep there little sprouts on the right financial literacy track - not on track don't fret we have all the guides in place to connect you to the proper resources!  Our challenge invites parents to come together as a community and share ideas- suggestions- what's working and more importantly what isn't. The app would provide forums searchable by key phrases such as how much does soccer camp cost? The app would grow with your sprout and connect parents by comparing their kids much like a development chart your child is in the 90th percentile for height and 60th percentile for weight.  OpenIDEO Chicago could connect with a local school to review curriculum - what are kids REALLY learning about finical literacy? Once we obtain more information we would ask a verity of parents to attend an open forum night hosted by openIDEO - we would ask questions to better understand parental and child motivation for educating sprouts and what milestones they would be interested in their kids accomplishing.  Ideally openIDEO Chicago would come up with a set of questions for other openIDEO communities to take to their local schools and/or parents. Do other regions- demographics- age groups want their children to learn different things or accomplish different goals? OpenIDEO Chicago would then synthesize the information and present it to the community in a concise format.  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 Roma community- students and financial experts will work togehter in desing new tool for simple access to financ. institutions and resources  Direct beneficiaries are 1000 Roma and other groups at risk for social exclusion in 4 municipalities in the country with highest percentage of Roma. Their educational level and employment rate is significantly lower in comparison to the national average. Age rage is from 18-62 years. Focus will be given to financial empowerment of Roma women. Also beneficiaries will be young Roma and non-Roma students and financial institutions included in design of the new tool and its implementation.  The idea will use power of young Roma and non-Roma student graduates (IT- finance- economics and social sciences)- representatives from financial institutions and direct Roma beneficiaries who will be joint to work together with community Coaches and Mentors in design and development a whole new set of services and tools that will ease access of Roma to financial institutions and resources.  The tool will be designed by students- financial institutions experts- community coaches and mentors- and Roma clients in one of the largest Roma communities in the countryTopaana located in country capital Skopje and then the prototype can be tried out in 4 municipalities with highest % of Roma inhabitants in the country (municipalities of Suto Orizari- Chair (Topaana)- Tetovo and Kumanovo) to find out if the proposed manner of support will meet out expectations.  OpenIDEO support is needed to identify new innovative ways to revive the traditional channels of communication- such as face-to-face and telephone communications—that are widespread in the Roma community- by adding new features that will make the distribution of information or access to advice more effective and accessible for Roma. The use of new technologies is also needed and will contribute to developing a truly multi-channel access to services adequate for the needs of disadvantaged Roma.  An organization ,0,0

 Empower people to treat their future selves- just a tiny bit- every day.  This idea benefits anyone who uses a credit or debit card regularly.  This idea is a very public method for getting people to acknowledge and invest in their futures. The goal is to start a wider conversation about investing in the future and financial responsibility within existing groups who spend money together (e.g. at restaurants- at clothing stores).  Establish a presence outside of a local banking institution and ask people to tip their future after they use the ATM. Ask them to step inside the bank to deposit a few dollars back into their savings account. Ask them if they would use tip your future to quickly and easily give back to themselves when using a credit or debit card.  Help to understand how different communities perceive saving and micro-contributions. Is saving a few dollars worth it? Do people understand the time-value of money?  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,1
 Use the proven effectiveness of networks and common goals to train better financial habits.  This idea will benefit those who want to develop better financial habits (regardless of financial position)- and those who want to be a part of a supportive- goal-oriented network.  This solution is designed to work within existing communities (friends- neighbors- family members- peer groups)- and/or to create a common- anonymous place for people with similar goals to find inspiration from one another. Quantified accountability within a community structure has proven wildly successful in the health and wellness space.Imagine if individuals struggling to pay just a little bit extra towards their student loan each month could find and support one another.

 What if every social enterprise pledged to hire one man or woman in need for a year program? We want to create a platform that makes it easy  These programs will benefitwomen and men who have just graduated from job ready programs through other non profit organizations and can't find jobs. Social enterprises should act as a stepping stone and help introduce them to a traditional workforce. They will be able to learn the skills they need to excel their financial and working knowledge. Social enterprises will also be able to asses their individual strengths for jobs in the future. There will be room for expansion in the private sector  This idea specifically uses the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources because job experience is crucial in achieving both. As a community it is a small responsibility that everyone can take to change someones life. Organizations like the Downtown Women's Center and Chrysalis do a great job in providing job training and resume building but not every student that graduates from their programs wants to do the work that they have. Everyone has a different dream job.  We could survey surrounding small business and social enterprises to see if they would be willing to take on one new employee and for what time frame? is one year too long? how much would they be able to pay them? is a mentorship a few days a week more likely? SOWN is a social enterprise that wants to do this work and not make social enterprises the dichotomy of earning money from one thing- and funneling it to the next. We want to practice what we preach and give women first hand experience.  We want to create a program so that it is easy for every social enterprise to hire on or mentor a man or woman in need. It shouldn't be a burden but a joy to give someone the opportunity to learn the skills and open up new financial opportunities and resources. Personal financial tips that you've grown up learning would be so valuable. We would be seeking expertise from the OpenIDEO community in how to create this platform and how to give these women the best tools to move forward.  A student project or collaboration ,0,1

 Scaling up BRAC's graduation model for the poorest : build an inclusive social network while introducing basic entrepreneurship training  This idea benefits the ultra poor. People living below 1.25$ a day are not an homogeneous pool and a unique set ofintervention is required for those in the lowest half of the group who live on 60 to 70 cents a day or less- eat below 80% of their energy requirements despite spending at least 80% of their income on food. The main players would be microfinance institutions who want to extend their reach.  This idea use existing structures such as NGOs or microfinance institutions to target the ultra poor and provide grants of productive assets (like livestock) as well as weekly stipends. The aim is to provide breathing room while they learn new livelihoods. The second step is then to encourage participants to save money while providing intensive hands-on training. Itmobilize community to integrate the ultra poor and give them the needed confidence boost.  BRAC already runned extensive research about this model- and has demonstrated the success of this scalable- household-to-household approach. Indeed- 75 to98% of participants met the graduation criteria. Evidence also suggests the approach can work outside BRAC's native Bangladesh.

 Collaboration and expansion of possible venture strategy for sustainable business and profitable community  This idea will benefit the banks- new financial ventures- existing SMEs- people near and below poverty line and the Microfinance venture. The main players would be existing and new entrepreneurs - existing and new farmers- associations supporting the local business and the government in the respective area. These key players will get access to finance- training and education on how to use new money and increase in quality of their life and increase in lower level of community  I would like to answer this with- again- my project Joint venture between ASA - OCF in Ethiopia. ASA will create alliance with OCF- coffee growers- and will provide them with funds. Also ASA will transfer their knowledge and expertise to empower and train the common businessman and new entrepreneurs in how to use new money and how to create sustainable business. Microfinance will be important tool because it will provide easy access to small amount of money to common population.  As explained- we can float a small venture in the region rich either with resources or with human capital. we will have to create the long term goal and long term profitability by identifying the scarcity of the market- local or global- and train & educate the local entrepreneurs in the particular field. This can be done in small scale but the timeline has to be defined and identified accordingly.  I would need IDEO's expertise in challenging the idea from basic.

 Encouraging communities to thrive with their own on-hand resources through a peer lending trust system.  This idea benefits: 1. communities with on-hand resources seeking financial empowerment; 2. individuals with savings looking for a alternative way to invest (lend) their money.  This idea takes advantage of the dynamics in a community (i.e. trust- organization- cooperation) to make it an attractive alternative investment solution for individual around the world. In turn- communities have access to a new financial resources (the savings of individuals).  Before launching any such platform- it is essential to test it on a micro-scale. Essentially- that means seeking out a local community with an on-hand resource looking for financial empowerment as well as a potential investor eager to help through investing. Testing the platform on a personal basis by word of mouth before launching it online is important. Discussing and getting feedback from the main players can insure a more successful system in the long run.  I'm looking for any constructive criticism to perfect this idea further. I realize it's an ambitious project- but poking holes- giving existing examples- and asking questions is key in aiding to make it successful.  An individual ,0,0

 The core concept of “Investment quest” covers the two sections of Investing from scratchand Building a portfolio. The game puts users  Our project is targeted at low financial literacy audience- to educate them through edutainment and reach out to them via social. We believe the knowledge they equip from Invest Quest will educate them with sufficient knowledge & realistic stimulation- dealing with unforeseen/uncontrollable market conditions to kick- start their first investment. The game also includes advisor to facilitate the players to react on various financial conditions.  The idea involves the communities in the world of virtual reality where- real cash flow concept is take into accounts. Therefore- market & transactions will be happen at real time- and the player's financial situation will be affected by the actions of the communities (e.g. high demand or low in supply will result in high pricing of a product or commodity).From this- the user will be able to learn the concept of careful financial planning and investment to improve their cash flow.  I will like to develop a mobile prototype on the game concept on financial literacy to gather initial interests of the community before moving on to develop a second life environment where- the real 3D interaction will grab the interests of the audience at a visual level.

 High school students participate in an after school mock stock exchange! (UPDATE 5/31/15)  This experience would benefit high school seniors and their families- by teaching students the basic structure and function of the stock market and engaging them in a unique opportunity to take part. This could develop as a new extension of already existing non-profit educational programs- and incentivize young people the way the real world incentivizes adults- with cash rather than grades- allowing them to learn about their role as future choice makers in a consumer-driven economy.  By gaining sponsorship from local businesses- the Mock Stock program could be run through a local YMCA or rec center on weekday afternoons and function like an afterschool club or sport. It would provide students who are interested in economics with an opportunity to explore the world of Wall Street using small amounts of money in reward for smart choices. TD Ameritrade might even donate their online educational tools if it means helping raise the next generation of buyers...  I could offer 3rd party workshops via Rainbow Tutoring- my friend's boutique tutoring company here in LA- which caters manly to high school students. A $5 buy in at the beginning of the program would be pooled and then rewarded to the student with the highest gain at the end. An experiment like this would allow us to gauge the willingness of teens to participate in a program like this- and track their interest so that the course structure could be amended for optimal engagement in the future.  OpenIDEO community members with more advanced knowledge of the stock market could greatly enhance this concept- contributing the details necessary for a more accurate replication of the real thing. Community members who have experience teaching and leading teenagers would be able to advise us on how to make sure the students enjoyed their experience and felt motivated to learn and experiment. It’s important that the kids feel they walk away from their Mock Stock experience with useful knowledge.  An individual ,0,1
 A kickstarter-like campaign- but within your local community- that allows neighbors to give money using SMS- or with cash at a local store.

 Making children realize the importance of exploring various ideas in order to gain financial stability.  This idea will benefit all school-going children. This is meant to sharpen their minds. teach them how to think and push them to explore financial options at a young age- which will make them wiser adults in financial matters. It also aims at tapping out the true potential and figuring out the subject towards which the child is inclined.  School teachers and the parents of the children will be actively involved in making this idea work. Using the power of spirit of competition- this idea will bring out the best of the minds together in order to make children financially competent. Cause As you sow- so you reap. Set the children thinking in the right direction and they will continue to do so.  Try and implement this idea in a school and observe the results over a period of time. See how it benefits in a long run.  Ideas to make it more appealing to schools and help to refine the idea.  An individual ,0,0
 A new financial product that leverages credit union communities.  Payday loans are a VERY bad finanical product that many resort to in order to make ends meet when unexpected shocks income shocks occur. Customers: Potential users of payday loans- existing users of payday loans. These users are given a lower interest loan than existing solutions.Credit unions: A new financial product that can increase union members liquidity and access to capital.  The credit union and its resources are essential to the development of a lower interest payday loan for its members. Unlike banks- credit unions are not-for-profit enterprises with a member first mentality. This means financial products can be developed with the customers interests in mind.  Financial structure of this product. I am unsure of the exact impact that a credit unions community could have on creating a substitute product to payday loans - whether it be your reputation within the community that grants you a lower interest payday loan or some element of collateral that you pledge to the community. Could you help me brainstorm this?  An individual ,0,0
 I'd like to contribute this idea as a PR strategy for our sponsors to utilize.  A. Beneficiaries - High school students and their families. It's well documented that financial behaviors start in the family. Like AA (alcoholic anonymous) those with in poor financial condition have a difficult time admitting to the problem. Role models- professional athletes- 'coming out' can have moving impact on others admitting to their current situation.B. Professional Athletes - Thought leaders for change- using their notoriety to give back and educate.C. Sponsors - PR strategy  High schools already serve as educational facilitators for local communities. However- there is an issue with gaining enthusiasm around 'personal finance' seminars and classes because well... they're boring- AND more importantly no one wants to admit they are confused by their finances. Given their celebrity status in light of their own money problems- athletes have the power to change the stigma associated with personal finance by being advocates for classes sponsored by local high schools.  1. Have a professional athlete visit their high school to speak about his/her money problems as an equal with the student body and their parents in attendance.2. Have the professional athlete advocate for weekly/monthly class that is sponsored by the high school.3. If this works- scale the operation with more professional athletes across high more high schools and establish a universal curriculum.  I have a question and a request. First the question: Do you think professional athletes as advocates for financial education actually have the ability to mobilize those who need it the most? Why or why not?The request: I am seeking our sponsors to help scale this potential campaign (if they see fit). Assuming of course this works in an experimental condition- professional athletes as advocates for better personal finance education has the ability to scale nationally (globally).

 A partnership between grocers- insurers- and banks that provides incentives for shoppers to 'invest' in their health with better foods.  The main beneficiary is poor families who are at risk of buying unhealthy foods to sate short term hunger. Better food saves health (and money) long-term.Grocers benefit when these customers buy higher-margin foods. They promote the program and provide infrastructure to track purchases.Insurers benefit from customers with improved long-term health- and reduced claims. They will pay forward incentives in an interest-bearing bank account for participants.Banks benefit from new users!  Each of these stakeholders -- shoppers- grocers- health insurers- and banks -- plays an integral role in the community. There livelihoods depend on one another. Although the symbiotic nature of their relationships has been short-circuited in many communities- we believe this idea can rewire the circuitry. Every actor is incentivized not only to participate- but also to encourage the participation of others. The greater the involvement- the greater the benefit for each who is involved.  The challenge will be to broker the initial partnerships and bridge the gaps of confidence that exist. Will a banker sign on? Sure- but only if they know the insurer will. But the insurer will only agree once the grocer has signaled long-term commitment. And so on. Early experiments would need to involve lots of discussion with each stakeholder. Not only will this help identify key concerns- but it will also engage their thinking in the process before it even begins. Talk to your grocer!  Health insurers – what data exist that link healthy eating with reduction in diabetes- heart disease- cancer?Banks – what regulatory hurdles stand in the way of partnerships like this? What impediments do you have to linking reward systems with other vendors?Grocers- food manufacturers – could this type of program integrate with your existing rewards programs? Or would it require completely different IT infrastructure?  An individual ,0,0
 Employers provide 1 hour of financial training per week to its low-wage hires during work hours to instill empowerment  This idea directly benefits low-wage workers who lack higher education and aren't able to get out of the cycle of poverty. They end up collecting life-long low-wage checks instead of fixing the root cause and changing their habits or gaining knowledge.The other main player would be the employer who provides the training. If the programs are optional- the attendance rate would not be as high as if the class was held during paid work time. (Benefits listed in next answer)  You are who you surround yourself with. Low-wage hires are spending a lot of time with others just like them who have the same mentality and habits. Financial training that is designed to be actionable can change the sentiment of the workplace. Hires will feel 1) accompanied by their colleagues- 2) that their employers care despite the low wages and 3) empowerment to change. The shift in mentality may lead to higher productivity from the hires than the cost of paying for the hour of training.  One way to test the idea can be to gauge interest by putting postings of financial trainings that are held during hires' off-hours.  -What would be the potential cost for a company such as Walmart to implement this training? -How difficult would it be for a company to be willing to implement this training? -Is in-person training the most effective platform?

 Our idea is about tapping into the potential of youth to empower their communities on financial literacy and creating opportunities.  Our idea is about tapping into the God-given potential of youth volunteers to empower other youth aged between 16 and 24 in urban areas in Kinshasa and small holders in rural areas neighboring Kinshasa- focusing on young girls and women- to become literate on financial matters and have the opportunity to get access to credit in order to make their livelihoods better through a better management of small businesses and social entrepreneurship.  The initiative will harness the power youth volunteers to empower their communities towards financial inclusion through training and creating opportunities for bettering their livelihoods. The first step towards achieving this will be to partner with financial institutions like FINCA International- and UN specialized agencies- like UNCDF- which will provide us with the necessary tools to organize a training of trainers.  We will conduct surveys in schools- churches- universities- and a neighboring small town near Kinshasa- to determine the needs for young people- small business holders- and young girls and women- for financial inclusion. The second step will be to organize a training of trainers- in partnership with FINCA and UNCDF. We will select a group of youth volunteers from among the Bridge volunteers- and train them on financial literacy as well as methods of financial inclusion.  We might be seeking guidance from the OpenIDEO community on the right research questions to ask to our users during our surveys- and better refine our idea.  An organization ,1,1
 Rent a basketball or soccer ball from a vending machine in trade for a tidbit such as: Bonds help your $1 today become $5 in one year!  The main customers would be teenagers who play sports as a form of hanging out with friends. Teenagers are an important demographic because they most likely don't generate income but are spending carelessly. The suppliers of the vending machines can include Mastercard which wants to educate teenagers on credit cards or a nonprofit which wants to impart knowledge on global poverty.  Teenagers don't have many viable options when hanging out with friends. Specifically in low-income areas- teenagers are heavily influenced by sports or music. This solution plays (pun intended!) on the mere-exposure effect and a community's love for sports . While the vending machines will make playing sports more easily accessible- they will also keep children off the streets while exposing them unknowingly to small nuggets of financial information.  Our minds are trained to rule out going to the park if we don't have a ball with us so it will take unlearning and relearning for people to learn and remember that a certain park rents balls. Do you think this habit can be changed?  -What are some ways to ensure the rented balls are returned to the machine given that we can't hold IDs or other forms of authentication? Or can the vending machines be designed to ensure this behavior? -How difficult and costly would maintenance be for the vending machine and balls?  An individual ,0,0
 What if you combined the addictively fun life simulation video game The SIMS and the growing financial software industry?  This concept would benefit the user by allowing them to navigate those difficult life decisions (specifically financial decisions) in a simulated real-world environment. The main players would be; for example- a large gaming publisher such as Electronic Arts and a reputable financial software provider such as Mint. This could pose an opportunity for these businesses to expand into new markets by providing educational products.  A Life Sim gaming environment uses the power of community in two ways. First- in the sense that it takes the strengths of specialists from the gaming industry and the financial software industry to deliver a new product that combines a simulated environment and professional financial advice. Second being the community of virtual people or Sims with whom your avatar would interact and play out scenarios.  The quickest and least involved method to get a bearing on the viability of this concept would be to conduct interviews in local communities. Statistics indicate that there is a potential market. By 2013- Electronic Arts had sold 175 million units since introducing The SIMS in 2000. In 2012 Mint topped 10 million registered users.  A.

 Invest in the next generation by pledging money towards students' college funds.  The idea benefits students in grades K-12 who need empowerment most. The idea of Marathon Learning encompasses a platform where students can create a personalized profile in which individuals in their network and beyond can pledge money towards their college tuition in exchange for earning good grades. Students from all types of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds could benefit from this idea with the promise that their achievements will be compensated with money towards higher education.  This idea would work similarly to how donors pledge money for miles a runner completes in a marathon—in this case the student's existing community is pledging money towards a number of pre-prescribed grades earned (whether those grades are As- Bs- or Cs depends on the specific student). Marathon Learning uses the untapped potential of the student's social network to further their education- and thus allows more students from low-income communities to become financially empowered through school.  To test this idea- I could use a high school student in my own network (ex. my 16 year old sister). I would have this student create a private Facebook page that highlights official academic progress- accomplishments- and goals. Then- I would have this student reach out to adults and financially able individuals within their community and social network asking for pledges of money to fund college in exchange for specific grades earned in the next academic semester.  I would need help programming this funding platform. I would also need help in ideating on the logistics of collaborating with schools. The platform involves ensuring that the student's grades reported are official according to his/her transcript- that the money pledged goes to a secure source used specifically for college- and that students cannot see each other's profiles.

 Go where people are already spending their time — on sites like Facebook- Google- Twitter — rather than hope for people to find you.  Social media sites are used by people worldwide. They are built on the idea of sharing and are act as virtual water coolers. They also appeal to our pride. We would help people become financially literate. We could partner with others (e.g.- MOOCs- finance experts) to ensure information is accurate and actionable. We could develop literacy training with progress broadcast through quizzes- certificates of completion- badges- etc. that would incentivize their network to do the same.  On social media platforms- we build the community ourselves with people who share common interests. We are therefore inclined to trust and be influenced based on what others’ post. We can be highly specific so our message reaches people who need it most. We would provide a virtual community and help them get connected to other people and resources in their physical community. And by its very nature- we would encourage people to share their new knowledge with others through word of mouth.  We could draft an online test to gauge people’s financial literacy and their desire to learn. We could distribute through advertisements on Facebook and Google based on their profiles and searches. Their feedback would tell us whether we need to reach people online- offline or both; whether we need to partner with organizations to develop a course or certification; whether they want to learn by reading- watching or listening.  I want to know if you think social media campaign would work. If you think buying ads and having sponsored posts affects the credibility of the informaiton. If it's important to partner with neutral third parties like a university or Suze Orman personality. If people would buy this idea. If you think they would bother to complete the training/do the work. How long that training should be.  An individual ,0,0
 Rounding up your purchases to empower people around the world.  This program is for anyone with a credit/debit card from ages 8-88- from anywhere around the world. They can enroll in the program if they wish to set aside money every month for the purposes of empowerment and alleviating poverty. On the other end- the borrowers of the money will have the power to create opportunities for themselves- whether through launching a small business or funding their education.  The idea suits the opportunity by connecting people through donating to empowerment opportunities- where the borrower will return the money with interest to a community pool of money or microfinance institution. Additionally- that pool of money can be used in that community to further fund other empowerment opportunities and develop the economy.  We can create a keep the change mechanism for a group of friends who may need money in times of emergencies. For example- with people who are paying cash- we can ask them to keep the change to put aside for donations to a specific person's empowerment opportunity. Say your friend at school needs to borrow $10 from you to urgently purchase school supplies for her next assignment. She will then return the money- with interest- to a pool of money for all further opportunities that may arise.  Should the accumulated change (on average $20) be donated directly to the empowerment opportunity (through a web-based platform like Kiva Zip)? Or directly to a microfinance institution? Should the lending pool of money be focused on that community or go back to a world wide audience?How might we get the person donating the change to feel more connected to the borrower and community they are helping to empower?

 Tackle communities' needs by estimulating physical and online Flea Markets to exchange goods and services in instead of money.  This idea benefits anyone who needs a good/service and has something else to exchange for it (apart from money). For the physical Flea Market it is necessary to have a space in the community (either block a street in partnership with governmental authorities or partner with a local school) and promote the activity to bring as many people as possible with its different offers (goods or services). For the online version it is needed a leader who will engageand moderate through a social network.  This idea proves that it is possible to be financial independent by only exchanging resources already available in the community. It is a just a matter of creating a connection and learning how to leverage from each other's capabilities and possessions.  To test the online Flea Market idea it is possible to pilot it within my facebook friends. I could create a facebook group to exchange goods and services and estimulate my friends to join and exchange among themselves. In that way I could see how much they like the idea and how it could be expanded and replicated.  It would be great if OpenIDEO community members could also try this idea in their own friendship circles and share their experiences and feedback here.  An individual ,0,0

 Communities and individuals need to understand not to save in fear- but to actually save in preparation.  If kids develop good financial skills from an early age they'll be ready for the financial challenges of adulthood.Giving our kids a good understandingabout money matters is critical for their personal development. Showing children the basics such as how to budget- spend and save will hopefully establish good money habits into the future.  It will be up to the individual commmunities and organisations to ensure strategies that focus on financial empowerment are adopted within schools and others places. Without the collaboration of such communities- these strategies will not be taken seriously.  We can possibly implement the ideas in a local public school- but the results are longitudinal and may not be suitable in this scenario considering the impact these strategies have on the next generation will not be realised for a number of decades  Strategies to develop financial empowerment in the younger generation that is both interactive and innovative  An individual ,0,0
 As more transactions go through smart devices- we can add a financial coach linked to your bank/credit cards to automate & help decisions.  We're absolutely in a consumerist society where people are encouraged to buy stuff- and retail therapy can override our decision making skills.See this SNL skit: http://tinyurl.com/qaopztz But what if when you went to checkout from a store using your phone- your phone said no because it knows you can't afford the purchase.This benefits consumers- limiting their debt- and banks by improving customers' credit.  This idea is really about changing a community value: don't buy stuff you can't afford just because advertising makes you want it.Be aware of what you're purchasing.I don't see a clear idea yet of how to integrate this with a community in a positive fashion- but perhaps it'll inspire someone else.  I could imagine a prototype app that knows the balance of your checking- savings- and investment accounts (and ideally credit card balances/limits). You could ask if can i buy something that costs $X- and it gives you a yes/no answer based on not just immediate balances but debt- what you should be saving- etc.. A next step would be having the app help you make a savings plan to save up to buy the item- perhaps even tied to a coupon hunting site to help you find the best deal when you can buy.  How could this work with a community?How could this be effectively implemented for someone who doesn't use Apple Pay/Google Wallet for purchases?What are the right incentives to get people using this since it won't be enforceable (just pay with a regular credit card)?Would it be feasible to have a special credit card that requires showing a yes answer to the cashier when using the card?

 Solving uneven distribution of capital and know-how problem by individually pairing wealthy philanthropists with entrepreneurs in need.  The main players are: 1) The wealthy philanthropists 2) Entrepreneurs in developing countries who need financial and mentorship support 3) The societyThe wealthy philanthropists will benefit from GMIP both on a spiritual and a professional level. Entrepreneurs in developing countries will earn access to the financial support and business guidance they desperately need to thrive. Finally- the society will benefit from the increased economic output and fully utilized various resources.  The urge to help one another is in the very core of human psyche. However- our philanthropic tendencies are impaired by many factors such as skepticism towards intermediary parties and the need to see a direct impact on receiver's condition. GMIP will use technology to individually pair philanthropists with people who need their help. Hence- the idle financial resources and know-how will be put in good use by escalating the self-actualization need in people.  I'm a Turkish MBA student at Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business. I could team up with some of my classmates to build the website as a platform and then talk to one of my professors who is known to be a serial entrepreneur to be the first mentor of GMIP. Then- escalating my international students network- I can find an entrepreneur from a developing country and pair them up to see the progress they will make via periodical video calls and follow-ups.  1) Is this idea scalable? How can we scale it?2) Given their busy schedules- how can we make sure that the mentors will commit to periodically spending time with our entrepreneurs?  An individual ,0,0
 A simple reminder of the 6 most important things to save for on a monthly basis. Small savings for a better life.  This idea will benefit people in rural communities or with low income in urban areas- that do not have the discipline to save. It can also be used by high school students- teenagers and for teachers to use it as a tool to teach. The SÄÄSTÖT reminder kit- comes with a calculator and a manual. The money from the SÄÄSTÖT reminder will be managed by banks. Other main players will be the community itself- since they will play an important role.  The role of communities is crucial in this idea- since we want to take advantage of the existing community structures- in order to collect the SÄÄSTÖT reminder. There are many rural communities that do not have banks. What we want is to use established grocery stores or local government offices in order to receive in a monthly basis the SÄÄSTÖT reminder with the money inside the envelopes. Also people who live in more urban areas could also use it- and use banks as intermediaries.  We could go into rural communities and create prototypes of the SÄÄSTÖT reminder in order to see the reactions of the people. We will explain to them that in order to be successful it is required only to save 20% of your monthly income for different reasons. With this experience we would be able to see the interest of the population and see if it would be feasible to do it. For people who lives in more urban areas- we could partner with a local bank in order to see the likelihood of SÄÄSTÖT.  I am seeking for new ideas of the actual implementation. Also I would like for the OpenIDEO community to help me figure out the fastest ways possible whenever a community member needs part of their savings- what will be some innovative ways to send them their money? How can we leverage the existing community structures in better ways? What other target markets should we focus?  An individual ,0,1
 In short- students earn money by going to class- good grades earn bonuses- and not showing up for class- like work is penalized.  The main beneficiaries are elementary- middle- and high school students that can test various work/financial behaviors in a quasi-game environment to see how it would affect real world issues. The main players are teachers- school administration- students and their parents. The students could earn real scholarship funds to post-secondary schools for their performance.  In my eyes- the key parts of improving personal financial performance are educating the population and understanding how behaviors affect one's financial well being. This idea attacks both by directly showing how personal behaviors affect financial well being. This allows the students to understand the cause and effect of personal life choices on ones personal finances without the life altering potential of making a personal financial mistake with real money.  The idea could be tested on a single class of students without a website by using monopoly money by providing small real life rewards to see how the students react to the game.  I would like to better understand how complex the game should be to keep students engaged and how much in real life rewards would help motivate the students.  An individual ,0,0
 Much like a 401K matching program- donors/banks/family/community members could match hard-earned savings of those who need help  The beneficiary of this idea would be working adults who generate an income- but can't make ends meet for their families. Such an adult would open a savings account through a bank- then a benefactor (traditional/private donor- extended family- the bank itself- etc.) would match the savings that the adult is able to generate. A charity or private donor would be the most likely benefactor- and they would benefit from giving money in an empowering way.  If this concept could flourish primarily through private donors who are willing to give money without necessarily seeing a return- then the power of communities would be harnessed in much the same way as Kiva.org.An online platform could be established to link benefactors with those in need of savings matching.  Reach out to known donors to see how receptive they would be to this idea.  I am curious as to who you (all) think would be most likely to match the savings of those in need.Might large financial institutions (i.e.- banks) match savings - to a limited extent - in the interest of Corporate Social Responsibility?Thanks!

 Development of social media tools to help new investors and socially responsible SMEs determine if they are a good match for each other.  Community health used to rely on everyone being able to invest in local companies- until most became a protected class deemed too unsophisticated to understand risks. Today- the 99% believe their only option is to fund retirement accounts or use brokers that only invest in national markets that look strikingly similar to casinos. And brokers and advisors don't have a way to overcome the risks of facilitating local investments. Both need a new paradigm to help match interest with opportunity.  There are already great ideas posted on IDEO in terms of new approaches to financial education- and this community of ideas can evolve towards the best approach to helping community members understand how to apply investing to suit their goals- and how their investment decisions can impact the things they care most about- and in their own backyard. And we can use the power of tools already developed- such as SASB- to help companies describe themselves- allowing us to match them to investors.  1. Ask companies doing Direct Public Offerings to respond to the SASB criteria to show their commitment to responsible practices. 2. Develop an easy to use questionnaire- or even a game- that allows anyone to find out what kind of investments would make them feel the best about- how much risk they can tolerate- and how much they can afford to invest. 3. Show each other the results- and allow them to match up. 4. If successful- introduce a broker to facilitate even more matches.  Anyone that wants to help develop a really awesome approach to allow people to first get educated about investing (perhaps using tools like what MARS has developed in Canada)- and then helps them try out some simulations to show them what kind of investments match with their objectives. A game approach could be fantastic. It might show they should stick with only safe investments- or it might show them that a portion back to a local SME could produce a great Return on Community.

 Use microcredit organizations to incentivize financial literacy in poor communities in a way that is also applicable in developing countries  Using the existing structure of staggered microlending- applying groups receive financial education (including personal finances)-supported by SMS and simple mobile phone apps- before receiving each round of financing. The group must pass each course’s test- which motivates learning and helping peers The idea benefits the financed groups- their community and MFIs involved. The group receives an empowering education to pay loans and manage family finances.MFIs benefit from higher repayment rates  Microcredit organizations already use a community structure- which is the informal financial mechanism available to the BOP. Since the loans are staggered- to access each new round of financing the entire group would have to take a course and pass the exam. Since every member of the group has to pass the exam- everyone has the incentive to study and help each other learn in order to receive the loan. This gives the community incentives to work towards increasing financial literacy of its members  1) Test whether finance is teachable to people from the BOP in an easy progressive way. Try teaching some topics to a diverse range of people from a vulnerable background. 2) Test the chosen syllabus with local MFIs. In many cases- MFIs involve some sort of training- such as a class at the start of the program- but do not have formalized multi-course structure. To test the experiment- we could introduce our idea to such institutions to test it on a small group of its existing members.  Advice or input on best syllabus for finance courses for the BOP. Advice or input on how text messages and simple apps can educate users. Advice or input on devices for the training courses: tvs- tablets- multimedia booths?

 Unleashing latent work and value with reputation and service currency- without reliance on or validation from financial institutions.  1. This idea benefits those who are willing and able to work- create- and serve others- but who individually or as a community- do not have adequate access to currency supplied by financial institutions- or the resources that this institutional currency provides.2. Main players: individuals that create value and provide services- and the communities they serve. 3. Individuals can be recognized and rewarded for providing services- and communities can benefit from more value and services.  This idea empowers communities to reward work- service- and creation of value without reliance on external institutions. The latent and unrealized work and value-creation capacity of communities due to the inability of actors within the community to pay for work or value-creation with institutional currency is immense. By empowering the community to reward work and value creation independently- that latent potential can be unleashed to improve the community.  Play a game with 2 groups of 10 people: Group 1: everyone starts with 100 potential points they can earn in 30 minutes- with 10 points they can receive from each other person. Everyone tries to maximize the number of points they can get by providing services. Group 2 (control group): 3 people have 1000 points between them to complete a defined task with the help of others. They must hire and direct them to completion.Which group provides more services- satisfaction- and innovative results?  Growth and adoption - determining the most appropriate methodologies for valuation of goods and services- deployment and growth strategies and tactics- and introductions to companies and organizations that would be interested in providing resources to make the vision a reality.System strategy and structuring - guidance on how to avoid pitfalls of creating a new currency- structuring the implementation strategy- and avoiding inequality or exclusion that could occur.

 Facilitating financial education for children through storytelling and engaging graphics that explain their parents’ monetary channels.  This effort would be focused on increasing financial literacy for children of all ages. By educating our youth on finances and how to make responsible decisions earlier in life- the hope is that everyone benefits. Also- by involving parents and illustrating real information- parents are able to communicate this information to their children in a fun and lightweight way- while their children learn about money as something real and important.  By introducing this engaging and accessible visualization tool- both parents and children will gain a heightened awareness of where money comes and goes within their family. This would not only be educational for the children- but increase transparency and dialogue between parents and their children.  I can interview parents with young children about their average spending habits- then ask them to keep track of their income and expenses throughout the course of a week. Then- using my customizable template- I can put together a simplified breakdown of these expenses into a short book and ask them to share them with their children. Then I would interview them again sometime later to find out if they or their children have behaved any differently with their finances.  I would be open to hearing any thoughts on how to execute this idea and what kind of output would be the most effective.  An individual ,0,1
 Create a board game about poverty and the importance of saving money  Children- parents of children- people interested in board games.  Playing games is essentially a community event.

 Create plays- musicals- TV dramas- songs- books and other media to secretly desseminate financial literacy education  This idea benefits people who like viewing- reading or listening to these media sources. They will learn about financial literacy- but might not really know that they are learning it. However- they will be primed to save more- to be more responsible and to help others.  Somethng that my friends and I talk about often are the shows- musicals- songs and books that we recently read/saw/heard. So by integrating financial literacy in these media sources- you are using word of mouth to spread the information that you hide in them.  create a short play to show to my friends and see what they think.  Lots. Help. I don't really know how to do any of this-how to create a musical- show or song. And how can we hide the financial education inside of it? No one wants to sit through a financial lecture- it has to be a funny- interesting show that just happens to have some financial information...  An individual ,0,0
 Social Media connected game to save $1000 in real life in one year  This idea benefits those who might have an extra dollar or two but don't usually think of saving it.  By creating a social media connected game- we are basically saying to all our friends I wills ave $1000 in one year. This public declaration is very powerful since our friends will hold us accountable and help support us on our way.  This doesn't seem like it would be very hard to program. We can pretty easily prototype it.  Help me figure out the logistics. I also need help programming this game.  An individual ,0,0
 Financial education doesn't just have to come from school- we can leverage all kinds of community spaces to talk about finances  This idea benefits people who live in an urban or suburban environment where groups of people gather to exchange ideas and information.  Communities gather at all kinds of places and for all kinds of reasons. I usually hear the best conversations at my hair salon. People talk about all kinds of things at Church picnics. The libraries are also a great gathering space for parents. One person that I know goes to a corner store up to four times a day. Restaurants and cafes are great for meeting new people and exchanging new ideas. Anywhere that people gather- we should be talking about financial health.  Start talking about financial literacy with the person next to me at a cafe or in line behind me at a store and see what their reaction is. It's breaking down these barriers that we as a sociaty has put up.  What do you think? How can we break down these barriers that prevent us from talking about financial matters? What are the best places that you get your information from?  A group brainstorm ,0,0
 Get texted once a day/week/month to remind you to save money  This idea is for someone who wants to save money but might not have the willpower or know-how to do it themselves. They might have a couple dollars extra and usually end up spending it- but with a little push from their text alerts- they will save it instead.  Almost everyone has a cell phone that can recieve SMS messages. Texting is as ubiquitious as phone calls- maybe even more. These financial reminder texts might come from a centralized system- but they can also come from individuals and groups of friends who are encouraging each other to save money.  I can set up a texting circle with some of my friends- who are interested in saving money themselves. We can all set individual goals and plan on sending out text reminders once in a while. We can also then update each other on our progress- making a support system for saving money.  How viable is this idea? What are its downsides or some potential potholes?  An individual ,0,0

 Providing easy to understand & fun feedback (like Apple Watch's Activity app) towards good financial goals will encourage better choices.  This idea benefits individuals by implicitly teaching them how to make smart financial choices- and the reward is that they will be making smarter choices- paying off debt and increasing savings.It's targeted at people ages 18-40 who interact with at least some of their finances electronically- as there's a potential social component (see the power of communities question).  Many of us are both competitive by nature and seek the approval of others.Providing simple feedback and progress indicators- towards general goals (having enough savings) and specific ones (saving towards a trip) gives us a shareable indicator (whether by showing someone or by sharing on social) of how we're doing.We can compete with ourselves (how we did before) or others (I reached my goal faster/achieved more badges) and get support from those we share our goals/progress with.  A very simple app/website to test how well this works would be a savings goal tracker with a leaderboard.You list your goal (e.g.- trip to Hawaii) and update the app with how far along you are.Rather than showing how far people are towards their goals- the leaderboard shows a momentum view: who's most continuously making the best progress towards their goal (plus % of goal achieved).This could aggregate across goals- too- so that you're higher up on the leaderboard for using it more.  Poke holes in this- let me know if there's anything like it- give thoughts about what a momentum view might be like- and if people like this- maybe there's a designer- Android dev- and web dev (I can probably handle the iOS side myself- time-permitting) who'd like to build it with me.

 The idea is inspired in Zaad- a cashless system based on mobile money operations in Somalia.  Zaad provokes to take a totally different perspective on payment system. Imagine the daily reality in Somalia- a country that has been struggling with internal conflict including a partition of its previous territory. Poor infrastructure- no formal banking system- hyperinflation and a weak currency. 1 USD is exchanged for 700 somali Shillings- for example. Imagine you paying 2.000 or 3.000 Shillings for small purchases at a corner store- now imagine carrying on the notes even for small expenses  The idea serves the lack of a banking system and provides safer financial transactions for its users- without the necessity to carry large amounts of cash even to pay small daily expenses. It tends to work well where the local culture is oral-driven and the mobile network has already a large usage.  I don't see a proper context in my country for this idea as the banks wouldn't appreciate get out of the control they currently have over every financial services - although there are opportunities to adopt it. For countries with poor infrastructure and no banking service- plus a large amount of time necessary to structure regulations and laws- it's a practical way to attend the population on their daily financial needs.

 Payment acceptance and savings through solar powered banking systems for remote regions without power and infrastructure.  This idea is for small communities in remote regions- such as India or Africa- that don't have enough wealth or infrastructure to support a brick and mortar bank.  A village in a remote community that has inhabitants- merchants- and service providers may have a hard time storing value in currency safely or investing their savings.The lack of a banking system is an impediment to economic potential- but potential isn't enough to support the fixed costs of a bank.Getting the members of the community to use a common electronic payment system that is denominated in the country's currency and uses limited infrastructure and solar power can solve the problem.  A test would be to get a group of merchants and consumers to adopt a common electronic payment card that interfaces with a solar powered ATM to deposit and withdraw savings.When a person works for a wage they can hand over their card to be electronically credited their paycheck by a solar powered card receiving device.That card then can be used to transfer the balance to a solar powered ATM- which communicates via satellite to a bank. Card and system take place of cash- no electricity needed  I found a solar powered ATM producer that makes ATMs that can withstand poor conditions and work without a power grid.I don't know if cards exist that can add or delete value without the need for a computer terminal.A small device with a screen that uses solar power would be needed to interact with the card in a similar way that a card swiper at a retail store works.I also don't know what major banks are involved heavily in developing countries that would take on such an experiment.

 Financial Education through Online Simulation  Financial education using online simulation can benefit any person who seeks to achieve financial know how and education by leveragingcomputer simulation towalk users through financial concepts. By using computer simulation- the users can get a better understanding of all finance concepts- since humans tend to understand things better with the help of visual simulation rather than by the traditional teaching approach as online simulation walks the user through a simulated real world setting.  The users of the virtual financial platform can from a common online community- such as an online forum- tointeract with each other just like in a real world finance setting and contribute their thoughts and ideas to improve the online simulation experience. Also experts from the financial community can join the virtual simulation community- and act as teachers- in order to give the users of the tool an in-depth insight of finance related concepts.  One can conduct periodic tests on the tool to determine if the tool contains any errors. Gathering feedback from the users of the online computer simulation tool- as to what more one can add or remove to make the user experience better will add value to the tool. Also- one can gather information as to how users have benefited from the tool and how much they have learnt- in order to assess the effectivity of the tool .  I would seek the guidance of the OpenIDEO community regarding steps to increase the number of customers using the tool by using better advertising strategies. Also- I would like the opinions of the OpenIDEO community as to how to attract financial experts to use the tool so that they can contribute to educating the users of the tool.  An individual ,0,0
 Agent Banking: Using the community member to form a network- which will provide financial services using external part as Banks.  The idea will mainly help the community member who are still unbanked and do not use the financial services in an efficient way. The main players would be: Banks- the bank will recruit the agents. The bank will get an extra network and ability to reach those customers who need the services. Agents- these agents will be the educated and financial aware part of the community. The agents will have an advantage ofactively working in the same community from which they have been picked.  We are using the agents from the community. The agents will be welcomed in most of the cases- as they are already the community. The community members can discuss their financial problems with them freely and agents being the part of the community will have initial knowledge of the needs and requirement of the community. This will be advantageous to both agent(banks) and community because the time lapse in understanding the needs is saved.  An early experiment would be to pick an unbanked community- find some participants to act as agents for the banks. The agents should be educated about their jobs- banks policies and financial products. These agents can do a survey on the needs and requirements of the people. They can urge the community members to use the financial services of the bank. The results can be evaluated based on the number of customers. A particular agent can be evaluated- based on age- gender- education level.  While choosing the community- one must know the exact needs of the community- do they saving schemes or they need small loans for their businesses. This information can be gathered through surveys. The best knowledge of the requirements will help the bank to formulate new products. They can educate the agents about their services- which will help the community to make better use of the agents.

 Funding of new projects by leveraging the World Wide Web  The idea of crowdfunding- using online communities in social network- will mainly benefit entrepreneurs who do not have the necessary finances to bring their idea to the market. Entrepreneurs who havean idea which they want to bring to life- with no direct access to banks or venture capitalists- will be able to avail funding from a large number of common people who believe that the idea will add value to the market through the concept of crowdfunding.  Entrepreneurs can utilize the social media and other online communities to build a community of followers who are interested in their proposed idea and are willing to fund the project. Crowdfunding helps entrepreneurs reach out to a large audience- who think that the entrepreneurs' idea will add value to the market- through a single click of a button- thereby helping the entrepreneur obtain the necessary funds to bring his idea to the market.  To test if the idea will meet he desired expectation- one can use online feedback forms in the same community to determine the number of potential investors interested in the project and also the number of ideas receiving the necessary funding. One can also perform data analysis on the data gathered- using free and open source tools like Weka and Excel- to determine what kinds of projects the members of the online community prefer to fund.  I would like the OpenIDEO community to help me come out with solutions to identify methods to increase the community strength through various online advertising methods.  An individual ,0,0
 Financial institutions providing free financial management classes to their customers and offering incentives to customers participating.  Individuals seeking a line of equity-ie; opening a credit card- or attaining a mortgage-in particular would benefit from this service because it would provide such individuals with valuable information about managing finances- which would in turn empower them to confidently manage their finances.This would also benefit financial institutions by mitigating risk.By providing education to people they are loaning funds to- financial institutions would increase their likelihood of being re-paid.  What better community to go about improving financial opportunities and resources than the financial community?Offering free financial classes to customers is a way for the financial community to give back to the community and also to benefit.The educational opportunities offered by financial institutions would mitigate risk and serve to attract customers.

 Teach communties how to reduce wast and to consume differently while saving money.  This restaurant/ supermarket idea- provide great products and gastronomic meals for consumers who could not otherwise afford it and allow them to eat healthier. It also benefits to industrials who wast less and sell their expired goods instead of throwing them away. Finally it benefits to the restaurant itself- so that can reduce prices by adapting margin and making significant cost savings.  Interviewing people in the community with different backgrounds. User testing.  I would love to discuss and brainstorm the topic of how to most effectively convey this information and concept to communities regarding legal considerations.

 A hybrid of finite peer-enabled training and ongoing phone-enabled engagement.  Youth in rural communities are the main players: the trainers as well as the beneficiaries. Enhanced employment opportunities- personal financial stability- elevated status and information-driven social networking are the main drivers for their participation.  The peer-to-peer component relies on the tight-knit- highly familiar structure of rural communities in which it is possible for an initial handful of trained instructors to spread teachings through their existing network by simple word of mouth. The phone-to-phone component enlarges the scope of the pre-existing physical community and- by giving everyone an equal voice on the mobile platform- introduces a new sort of power in the form of democratized expression.  Alas- my current home in Hong Kong doesn't resemble the rural context I have in mind- but the idea was inspired by observations from the tech accelerator and co-working space I launched in January (www.blueprinthk.com). I'm intrigued by how in-person collaboration - whether it be to use the espresso machine or prepare an investor deck - continues and evolves on Whatsapp- Instagram- Facebook etc so I could consider initiating a semi-comparable experiment around finance in this community.  It would be great to hear from people who have implemented a peer-to-peer learning scheme. I recognize the risk of romanticizing a hypothetical community in which altruistic members dedicate time to their betterment and that of others. I'd also appreciate insight into the psychology of rural youth in developing economies on the topic of financial literacy - is it something they identify as a valuable skill? How much convincing is required when first knocking on their door?  An individual ,0,0
 Meeting the immediate financial needs of homeless community members by providing transportation and peer support.  Homeless individuals and families living in a shelter or a place not meant for human habitation.It can also inform macro-economic institutions to better understand the specific limitations and local roadblocks within existing systems- as well as community organizations doing outreach with the homeless.  This model fosters a connection between formerly homeless community members- human service organizations and individuals and families who are trying to escape homelessness.SHARE-Fi MOBILE provides mentor-ship opportunities from those who know what to expect from local resources and services.  I have access to a community of homeless veterans. I have a close relationship with a man who has successfully navigated his way out of homelessness . He now lives on his own and pays for all of his living expenses on his own. We can test-drive the Share-Fi Mobile model by doing outreach with homeless veterans to perform a needs assessment. This will allow us to determine if the homeless community is interested in having access to a mobile unit that can bring them to their appointments- etc.  Help creating a visual guide for personalized Share-Fi Mobile curriculum.Help building a corresponding website/blog to share the progress and lessons learned.

 I aim to elaborate a schema to increase efficiency at the workplace by keeping employees busy.  The idea benefits both the employees and the employers. Employees would have the opportunity to fill their empty work schedules with new- challenging- and yet satisfactory work that would help them both: a. improve their current set of skills and knowledge; b. gain additional bonuses to their hourly/monthly wage/salary. On the other hand- by increasing productivity and engagement levels- employers would be reassured that the money they pay for benefits are well worth it.  Communities have always played a huge part in our lives. More often than not- we subconsciously engage in activities that we think would be appreciated by the those who surround us. Communities- especially labor communities- value efficiency and improvement; thus- under their influence- workers would consciously seek out multiplication of tasks in order to demonstrate a new talent or an improvement of an old one.  A potential experiment could be conveyed in any workplace. The duration of the study- however- has to be no less than six months- in order to assess a stable and gradual progress in employees' motivation- satisfaction- and efficiency. What is expected at first is a negative outburst from the employees since changes are never desired; they promote insecurity and distress. However- once the employees get used to the new regime- they would see the progress they have made themselves.  OpenIDEO could potentially help connecting companies with researcher consultants- and provide guidance throughout the research process. Another way of contributing to the project would be a further training and sharing of accumulated experience.  An individual ,0,0
 We can reimagine the community space as one that promotes the Seven Dimensions of Wellness and creates a grassroots approach.  For people to be participatory in society- change- and innovation it's vital that every individual have a platform for overall well-being. Taxable income or private philanthropy will be allocated to establish education programs that teach strategies of achieving The Seven Dimensions of Wellness (Social- Emotional- Spiritual- Environmental- Occupational- Intellectual- and Physical). Educators will teach how these dimensions can be beneficial both in personal lives and occupational situations.  The benefits of wellness extend far beyond one's personhood. An overall sense of wellness can be promoted within working environments- daily interaction- and governmental provisions. Financial opportunities and resources can be improved when private enterprises- NGO's- as well as advocacy organizations equip local citizens with resources to be autonomous in commerce- safe working conditions- as well as incentives to earn an income from pre-existing skill-sets (some native to that culture).  We could reach out to business courses and create a service-learning project within some facet of an entrepreneurship curriculum. An example of this would be pairing business students and University education with local textile producers in the region to help them establish a small business from their skill-set. Furthermore- we could provide business workshops for local workers and encourage individual business autonomy.  What would be the best method of analysis in regards to the results of these individual start-ups? How can we measure (qualitatively/quantitatively) one's overall wellness?  An organization ,0,0
 An Interactive tailor-made financial education program- given through mobile classrooms in order to create sustainable communities.  Rural communities are the ones who will benefit- by learning financial knowledge through interactive sessions in the mobile classrooms. The Program will be tailored-made for poor rural communities- developed with a professor from the community and an expert with financial background. The main players will be the community who lives in urban areas and feel the sense of responsibility to help those who need it most. Those who receive education are required to teach along financial knowledge.  The financial education of communities in urban cities should be leveraged and help those who live in poverty rural areas. The rural communities run little businesses such as grocery stores. The people who run those small businesses sometimes operates at a loss for lack of financial knowledge- and eliminates their potential growth. With the SIME program the people in the community will be able to operate profitable businesses and give them the tools to manage their finances in start-ups.  To make a prototype the best way is to use your own resources. I own a truck and a trailer that I could use for the SIME classroom. An example would be inviting the community in Guadalajara Mexico to participate and help their neighbor rural communities. I have friends that have financial backgrounds and digital media experts. We can create an interactive video that will teach financials to small business owners from the community who operate at a loss. We could check the improvement in 2 months  I would be seeking collaboration from OpenIdeo in finding ways to create the best Interactive Video- and find people who are in the education field. I would like to find also people who could help me with the design of a SIME mobile classroom. I would also need feedback from OpenIdeo members who have previous experiences in rural communities- in order to findinnovative ways to implement financial skills to the community. I would need feedback of how to improve my idea and make it feasible.  An individual ,0,0
 Credit card that changes colors in relation to your spending habits and your high balance threshold. Green=good- yellow=slow down- red=stop  Benefits the consumer and the financial institution. For the consumer- conditions them to have better spending habits- which allows the financial institution to have consumers who don't default- pay debt more readily- are in better financial standing and therefore can afford other bank services like investment accounts. Benefits retailers because consumers will have more money for purchases in the long run.  Openly encourages good behavior between consumers as every consumer's spending habits/status are clearly visible. Could encourage competitions- like selfies- that show people spending wisely.  Can make any item—like a t-shirt- wallet- purse- sign—that shows a consumer's current financial standing openly for others to see. As spending habits increase or decrease- the visual status changes accordingly. Can perform the experiment for a month and see if it changes behavior or raises self-awareness.  Feedback.

 Developed in an Open IDEO session in SF: Allow individuals in a community to act as a bank for other individuals (ex. check cashing).  The idea benefits members of a community that lack access to financial services such as check cashing- payday loans- and small business loans. Community members with access to financial resources could act as a fragmented banking institution offering these services. Our proposal would facilitate this system of relationships and transactions.The benefits for the community members acting as mini banks would be either a feeling of social goodwill or profit incentives.  Our idea taps into the power of fragmented community resources such as individual bank accounts and access to technology that not all community members may have access to- but that as a community- neighbors can share. One person in a community or multiple members in a community can vet other community members through mechanisms such as social underwriting to provide services such as loans- check cashing- etc. in a distributed way to community members that cannot access traditional services.  We can ask if community members would feel comfortable acting as a distributed bank for other community members if there was a way to vet them through social underwriting.  What kind of technology is needed to implement an idea like this? How do you create trust with those acting as the bank and how do you create credibility with those that would access this bank of community members? How do you build a network?

 Spending money is fun- yet saving should that be as well. This idea triggers people to do so and makes it fun.  Big spenders with a hole in their hand. People who get the adrenaline kick from impulsive purchases- but ends up with money stress and a bunch of unused items at home.  The communities control the spending patterns and at the same time are the trigger to save more.  Create a 'wait' feature or a time lock on your wallet.  Create an online community where relatives and friends earn credits when saving money. After each purchase you loose credits- but the longer you wait the more credits you earn back. Every week you have to point out together the 'Big Spender Of The Week'- and that person needs to walk with his 'Stop...saving time!' shirt.  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0

 A school/district wide platform for kids to spend- save- borrow and crowdfund for the stuff they want.  The main players are the kids! They will be able to learn by doing insofar as they will be able to use the currency to spend on stuff they want- borrow to start their own businesses (think lemonade stand) and crowdfund for larger initiatives like sports uniforms for the soccer team.  A program for kids to be able to use a school wide currency that can help them access stuff they need- and in doing so provide them with an opportunity to becoming financially confident. We believe monetary system doesnt need to be competitive to be efficient. We designed a system that enables collaboration amongst kids across district. They work together to achieve their goals and learn that a stable financial system means working together and supporting each other to achieve their dreams.  Ask kids in one classroom to come up with business ideas that they can run within their school- provide paper money for them to set up their business- once they are earning they can invest in communal projects and reinvest to grow their ideas beyond the small business to a district level.  How does one make monetary systems more collaborative and less competitive?How would this be feasible in a school? How best to relate to kids and students?

 An opt-out- rather than an opt-in- program of embedded charity at the checkout line.  This will benefit charities- and is designed to benefit any charity of the company's choosing. There are three main players here- listed in order of importance: a company's customers- the company itself- and the charities. Each receives a tangible good. The customers have the satisfaction that they are doing good- without paying much for it; the company can donate large sums to charity without expending any of its own capital; and the charities receive money.  The businesses sign on to this program- and then solicit the community for input on what should be funded. The community then decides which causes or goals it would like to fund- and then directs the local businesses on what to do. Basically- a virtuous cycle between business and community. The best part? The entire apparatus of buying and selling remains unchanged- and only a small part of it is redirected for specific ends directed by the community- the state- or the national government.  Try it with a single business to check participation rates- customer feedback- and the overall success of the program.

 An innovative member-owned defined benefit plan and target date fund  The defined benefit co-op will help a person seeking to connect their monthly savings with future goals by pooling their resources with other members who in many cases will have similar goals. It will help people at the low income end of the spectrum plan to send their kids to day care- it will help middle-class folks plan a down payment on a house- it will help retirees live within their means. As a co-op- members will have the ability to steer the focus to where they see areas of need.  The co-op's mission is to find the best ways to serve its members. By bringing together people from different geographic and socio-economic backgrounds- the co-op creates a new kind of community which seeks to help all members of the community with the financial planning and investment aspects of achieving their life goals. The co-op has the ability to pursue creative- outside the box- community oriented- & non-financial solutions for its members.  This is a tough one. We find a million people from all walks of life- create a co-op- get seed capital from a social impact fund- hire an investment manager and creative head of operations- and ... I need to think about this..  Nothing big- just ah- hop on board- throw out the prevailing approach towards finance of self-reliance and individual planning- and dream big about how can we create a pooled target date and defined benefit co-operative that will help people from all walks of life define and achieve life milestones.

 Create a data visualization toolkit to make mind-boggling financial literacy concepts intuitive.  These data visualization tools will benefit numerous groups of individuals who find budgeting and planning bewildering because of the overwhelming number of numbers involved- the opaqueness of current tools- and the depth of understanding of the underpinnings of finance (compound interest- time value of money- risk vs. return- and so on). The first visualizations that seem high priority are budgeting & saving and medium to long term planning.  The data visualization toolkit can be adopted by any financial literacy curriculum to supplement their teaching program- so- if created well using human-centered design principles and a financial literacy domain expertise- it will hopefully be a refreshing use of technology and design that will help keep curriculums engaging- relevant- personalized- and intuitive. The toolkit can also be used by financial service providers to better serve their clients.

 Where homeless individuals in the process of rehabilitation can learn how to financially take care of their basic human needs.  Who It Benefits: Homeless individuals who are looking to make a fresh- and financially stable start in life.Main Players: Members of the community with the creative know-how- and financial planning skills to educate others on how to live prosperous- economically comfortable lives on a budget.What's In It For Them: Using their expertise to help others who need it most- and strengthening the social and financial standing of their community.  Maslow's Street Fair would directly connect homeless individuals with members of their community in an active- and communicative environment. Community volunteers will set up displays- showcasing the innovative ways they thriftily take care of their essentials needs- and rehabilitating persons will be able to learn from their peers on a hands-on- conversational platform. This promotes economic togetherness- financial independence- and gives a lighthearted essence to a serious situation.  Before taking this idea outside- the best place to start would be inside. Teaming up with local homeless shelters will give us the opportunity to display individual tactics right inside of these homes. For example- a demonstration on how to cook healthy food on a tight budget can be set up inside of Next Door Shelter for the benefit of the residents. This would promote the street fair by sending it to the front doors of the homeless- and getting them familiar with the helpful tactics available.  A person- or group- that has experience in social services- or liaising with community partners would be an appreciated asset to communicating with homeless shelters- as well as deciphering the needs of the rehabilitating homeless.Would there be anyone who knows a practical structure for planning and executing a street fair or festival? It would be a great help in the planning process- as well as finding community members who are willing to showcase their financial skills.  Other ,0,1
 Establishing an Effective Financial Literacy Program for the Patrons of Oakland Public Library  This program will benefit the patrons of Oakland Public Library. Patrons will have the chance to learn skills and be exposed to tools that will help them with their financial goals. It could range from setting those goals to achieving existing goals. It will likely range from making a budget for setting aside $10 a week for a safety net- to building up a down payment- to getting started on a business idea- to planning out a 529 college savings plan to send kids to college.  Libraries are existing community spaces readily seen by the communities they serve as safe and trusted places to seek assistance. Libraries have a long history of providing services to their communities- from kids programs to adult literacy- and they appeal to a broad range of people. As a bonus .. libraries have the two core infrastructure elements needed to house this program: physical meeting spaces and computer access.  A. There are a variety of analogs. We can look at and sit in on programs being taught at nearby libraries (San Francisco Public Library offers programs through http://projectmoney.org/index.html and smart money @ your library- for instance); B. We can look at assessments of non-library programs offered to a similar set of constituents; C. We can teach a few small pilot courses.  A. Help refining the high level goals and philosophy (To meet all library patrons at their current level of financial literacy and provide ongoing training and support) B. Help with strategy and design- for instance: Is OPL the right scope to start with? Too big or too small? What parts of the curriculum could be adopted versus need to be created (i.e.- the age old build vs. buy question). C. Volunteers to teach some initial courses and gather feedback. D.

 Borrowing from the direct-sales business model- Face to Face lending relies on social networks to distribute credit.  This business will serve the 38% of US adults currently unbanked or underbanked.More specifically- the Face to Face lending targets the current customers of predatory lenders like payday lenders- title lenders- etc.The goal is to offer access to credit that is cheaper that current options and provide a path for building credit scores.  Similar to the health promoter model- Face to Face Lending will be built on credit promoters and their ability to affect the behavior of the communities where they live.Credit worthiness is more than a number given you by the credit agencies.It is the people you know- and the people that know you- and the family and community ties you to everyone else.Face to Face Lending will let borrowers build on that foundational concept of trust.  I can recruit one or two credit promotors to not only test assumptions about the model- but also pilot a few small dollar loans.  I know I need help with a) understanding how to engage with credit reporting agencies- b) building partnerships with mobile payment systems- and c) building partnerships with rechargeable cash card companies.I also need help identifying my assumptions and building a profit model. I also just plain need folks interested in working on this.Drop me a line if you have relevant skills or are just plain interested.  A student project or collaboration ,0,1
 By creating conceptual economies in class- students can learn to better manage their finances early and carry on such skills later in life.  This idea inherently benefits the youth and is largely reliant on educators. Nothing is keeping students from bringing these practices back home- however.

 Individuals are able to establish and grow their savings by being incentivized to utilize their own will power.  •Individuals struggling with saving money: This program will empower individuals to establish and grow a solid savings account through incentives •Banks/Credit Unions: A new customer base is formed of individuals who could go on to utilize other bank provided services as well•Overall community: Individuals in the community become more financially secure which allows them to support the local economy and become less dependent on possible non-profit and government services  Local banks and credit unions would create special savings accounts that incentivize individuals to maintain or increase the amount of money they save by offering special interest rates or matched savings to those who achieve certain savings goals. The additional funds could be potentially be sponsored by individuals or partner organizations as well.  A good place to start would be to work with a local credit union which will have more control over the way they manage their business locally. They can open up this option to a key segment of individuals who would most benefit from this service – for example potentially partnering with local high schools and their students who are most likely just beginning to establish their own savings accounts.  What are the regulations within the banking industry that may result in potential barriers? Who are the segments of individuals that this would most benefit- and how do we reach them? Who should be considered as a potential partner for funding or support? What are the savings goal requirements needed in order to obtain incentives? Should they be established on an individual basis? How do we communicate the return on investment for all stakeholders?  Other ,0,0
 We can improve financial literacy with an educational program that teaches older students who then pass along lessons to younger students.  Main players: * Community Leaders: Individuals within any community that can mobilize buy-in to programs; ideally possessing a strong understanding of local financial institutions * Students: Students would be broken down into each grade level or age group from oldest youngestWIIFT: An effective program requires a minimal time commitment- but provides a positive sense of community involvement.Primary Beneficiaries: * The entire local community would benefit as all members are involved  Inspired by the Junior Achievement Program (juniorachievement.org)- this idea relies on community leaders and established educational systems. The structure would be as follows: 1. Community leaders (such as parents or PTO's) would divide into groups to visit and teach financial literacy to upper-level classrooms for one day.2. The students that were taught that day would then separate into groups and teach a younger class the next day. 3. Repeat step 2 for all student age groups.  Anyone can experiment with this process in their community- simply by volunteering a day out of their schedule to teach a local class about financial literacy concepts. There are numerous resources to make these lessons entertaining and informative (many of which were touched on during the research portion of this challenge). Then after you teach the class and answer any questions they have- encourage them to volunteer to teach a younger class. Work with their teachers to make it an assignment.  Numerous sources provide recommendations for financial literacy programs- but a standardized program that is flexible enough to be adapted to any local community regardless of language could best be built through a crowdsourced effort such as is possible with OpenIDEO. So refining this community-based program should be thought of as a community effort.  An individual ,0,0
 A healthy cleanse for your wallet and bank account.  Everyone.  Americans are addicted to credit. It is easy to think credit is debit but it is not. Credit is credit and we need to stop feeding our addiction. It is time for America to cleanse its wallet and start being responsible and conscious of their spending. We need to be accountable for ourselves and each other.  Just like a rehab program- treat this the same way. We have to get used to not spending what we don't have and change our lifestyles. Understand commercialism and consumerism to know why Americans are addicted to credit.  I would love people working in finance- account management- risk management- etc. to assist with their skills and knowledge.  An individual ,0,0
 Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime - Proverb  1. Churches in the local area. They will be able to evangelize their mission- assist the needy- and grow their community in numbers.2. Local community. People who need/want to learn new skills now will be able to for free.3. Volunteers. Overall good feelings and add volunteerism to their resume.  In any local community there are vast resources of human knowledge that can be shared and given to others who would truly benefit. And what better place to share than at a place already designed to welcome the most needy in our community- a church. People from all backgrounds and professions attend various churches. These people have a lot of knowledge and work experience they can teach to others in their local community- especially in basic computer- language- and life skills.  Find a megachurch that is willing to host a learning seminar and provide a pool of potential volunteers from their congregation. (Preferably in a neighborhood with a diverse community from low to high-income wage workers) Research what skills are most needed in the community (i.e. learning how to use the internet to research- learn basic English skills- financial management). Then have volunteers to coordinate and promote the seminar at the local church and see if people will attend for free.  Work with local non-profits and churches who are heavily involved with assisting the needy.  An individual ,0,0
 Richmond's collective of successful business people collaborate with local charity groups to make Richmond a self-sustained city.  This idea will benefit the entire community of Richmond- from local to corporate businesses and business owners- to the poverty-stricken homeless. Richmond's unique circle of successful friends and colleagues; college presidents and administrators and former pro athletes- will invest in businesses to create jobs specifically for the youth. They will help promote care and outreach to get people off the streets- and employ them- or find them employment elsewhere.  It will be 100% community run and operated. Not only will community members be meeting and interacting primarily- only with Richmond residents- the entire operation will operate out of Richmond. Those who have been successful financially will offer financial mentorship to members- as well as promoting higher education- and career/future building. over time- the success of the program will inspire people to invest in themselves and their community- creating a sense of financial responsibility.  Step 1. Find a candidate — Search local centers that provide job search help for someone willing to receive outside help finding a job. Step 2.Find a local business. — Contact businesses in the area- preferably a self-owned business- willing to hire a qualified individual- down on their luck seeking employment. Step 3. Over a 6 Mo. Span- Coach 'em up- track it —Use our network to provide financial advice to the individual during his work. —Promote and expose advancing opportunities  I am curious to know of programs such as this- that may have been tried- or are in progress around the world that someone may personally be familiar with. What are some aspects of the operations of the program that may or may not have worked? Can a small group (15-20 people) of financially sound locals in a primarily low-income area have success against a gentrification in progress- in your experience or opinion? Does this seem realistic?

 Wouldn't it be revolutionary if we could use the trust and authority of religious spaces for financial inclusion?  Religion is a powerful force in that it can be universal- but may also target those excluded by financial institutions.I was recently in Nepal andnoticed that the religious sites there were often used by those identified in the research phase as being particularly in need of financial empowerment (e.g.- women- those without salaried employment).Further- religious networks may extend further than other forms of authority (e.g.- government services) be able to include the most remote.  Shared faith creates communities with strong internal ties.Religion can inspire its members to be charitable to their co-religionists in ways that for-profit financial institutions may not.In many contexts religious leaders have a great deal of trust and authority among their constituents and may be powerful as financial educators or example-setters.Some religions create physical spaces which members visit regularly.These could be powerful locations for reaching many people efficiently.  We could organize a short-term loan program at a local church to see if local parishioners would be willing to lend money to a member of the congregation.We could also compare this to willingness to do the same for people outside of the congregational community.We could survey to see how much religious figures are trusted versus other forms of authority (e.g.- friends- family- gov't officials- celebrity)- though this will definitely vary by region!  Because religious practice is so varied by location- thoughts from OpenIDEO users around the world as to whether this would work in their cultural context would be really important.Perhaps a community member knows of a particularly successful program executed in a community near them?

 A youth campaign that taps the power of young people to change the way we think and talk about money.  Like the voting movement of the previous decade- this idea taps into the power of younger generations to change the conversation around money. By engaging students- ages 18-early twenties- we can start to build energy around the importance of financial education and begin to change the stigma around needing help. By getting the younger generation excited about their financial health- a sort of grassroots army is created. They can achieve financial stability and pass it down the line.  The idea is a kind is modeled after the PAC- grassroots movement- Rock the Vote. It gets young people involved to spread the word and change our social norms. One of the biggest challenges in any education initiative is motivation. By getting young people involved- we tap a very large- very active social network to create a buzz and stir interest in financial education.  A local campaign can be created in one or more cities- using social media and a University and contacts in the PAC and grassroots sectors. By using the student loan conversation as a hot topic starting point- we can start a Facebook/ Linked In page to measure buzz and reach and hold brain storming events at a couple of universities where we can observe attendance and enthusiasm- while also collecting ideas from students.  How can we get a buzz started? Does anyone have experience with starting a grassroots campaign? Would anyone be willing to initiate a campaign at a University and hold a brainstorming session? What kind of visual and social tools can we use to engage young people?  An individual ,1,1
 Connect current resources through a collaborative platform  A collaborative platform would expand access to financial education in communities with credit unions- schools and community centers for students and adults of all income levels who struggle to manage their debt- save money and plan their financial future.  This concept leverages existing bright spots by creating a platform that would bring them together to share their ideas and success stories in order to streamline their efforts and build strength in numbers. It can act as a direct resource for those seeking help- as well as a place where volunteers can find opportunities to give back to their community. It pulls communities together for a common cause and would become a place where people can both help others and receive help.  I have mentioned the concept to the Chaco CEO and he feels strongly that collaboration is the key to effective education. I have a few contacts in my network of some like-minded organizations including credit unions- schools and churches that may be interested in participating in a trial platform. A light test could be performed by setting up a sample and tracking their enrollment numbers and demographics before and after combining efforts with the launch of the platform.  If anyone has experience in launching a collaborative network before- I would be interested to hear about what shape it took - how it went- what challenges were faced- etc.This idea was sparked by interviews with Chaco Credit Union- does anyone out there know- or work with a similar organization that may have something to add?The platformdoesn't have a shape yet. Ideas are welcome to begin to shape it into a more concrete model. I am available for brainstorming. Let's work together!  An organization ,0,0
 Making saving fun through prize-linked savings accounts to incentivize sound financial decision-making  Prize-linked savings accounts work best for individuals who need incentives to save -- helping bring the unbanked online and teach the merits of saving for those who are less inclined to do so. The idea is attractive to customers as they function both as a lottery -- providing the thrill of winning a prize -- as well as a long-term savings account built off these deposits.  The goal is to help bank the un-banked and bring new types of customers into the financial system. You could pilot the program in a small community. One way to demonstrate the value of the project is to run a demonstration over several months where half the group regularly purchases traditional lottery tickets- while the other half participates in a prize-linked savings system- to illustrate the value of investing.  At least in the U.S.- there are regulatory restrictions around who can operate and run a lottery. The right to run a lottery is limited to 47 jurisdictions- 44 states- DC- Puerto Rico- and the Virgin Islands. I believe that city governments or non-profits that want to launch PLSAs are barred from doing so. How could this idea be leveraged in more feasible structures that do not have regulatory constraints?  Other ,0,0
 Teach urban communities how to stock their kitchen and cook in a healthy- financially responsible way.  This will help adults in urban environments who have access to good- local produce- but don't know how to cook at home in a healthy- financially responsible manner. The idea of the celebrity chef has convinced middle-class individuals that cooking at home should be a rare occasion- and all excess food should be discarded (see this TED talk by Tamar Adler on the phenomenon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al2rZKXnJxQ). This leads to wasted money- wasted food- and less healthy meals.  Communities have so much legacy knowledge on cooking- in various ethnic traditions that have been handed down for centuries. I'm particularly interested in showcasing basic cooking techniques that provide a more sustainable way of cooking at home using large batches of local produce- which can then be portioned off for the week to come (such as those featured in Tamar Adler's book- An Everlasting Meal: Cooking with Economy and Grace).  Interviewing people shopping local farmers markets- to test basic assumptions around cooking literacy- and interest in discovering techniques that are more cost-effective and sustainable.  I would love inputs from teachers on how to most effectively convey this information- impact analysts on the numbers behind the problem of food waste- and technologists on how to build a scalable platform that empowers cooking at home.

 Stop welfare abuse and enable aspirations  Benefits those who have no choice but to be on welfare due to physical or mental reasons. Enables all others who want to lift themselves out of poverty. World class companies make trillions and help billions. The two simple ideas are firstmake welfare a last choice so that people select it as a last resort.- second use technology to make larger and larger loans/credit lines available at low interest rates which are the same for rich or poor borrowers.  The main value is fairness. Help only those who genuinely need help and design in such a way that most people want to get off welfare. Make those who succeed role models and glorify them. Communities can volunteer time and money to take care of the genuine welfare cases. Affluent community members can also volunteer time to skill the poor in their communities and provide them livelihoods.Recognise that there is no need for public money to end poverty  In India we are looking at experimenting in one state or union territory with uptosixty small projects to test out and refine models based on these two simple design ideas. We are optimistic that these experiments will start by July 2015 but there maybe delays or the experiments may never start.  At IYM www.iymetros.com we welcome interaction to see if our ideas are good or if there are better ideas. Step 1 is to help the experiments to get started and then to help during the experiment phase with the aim of creating a feeding frenzy among world class companies to invest and innovate because they see a big pot of gold and the ability to end abject poverty by 2025.

 By helping women in kakuma with access to loan would enable women like Annociata to be self-dependent.  This idea would benefit women. How? By enabling them to have the sewing machine and open sewing room. At the end of the day- it would help them to equip other women with reliable skills that will enable them to earn and save.  There are women like Annociata who are skilled with hand craft skills and this idea is using those already skilled women to empower other women around them and at the end of the day work hard to ear and save as a means for women to improve their financial opportunities and resources.  The example is Annociata together with her group. They all skilled with hand crafts skills and they work hard to earn and the little they get helps them to sustain their families. Since the expectation is to help other women with skills which will serve to enable to earn and save as for them to be self-dependent; I think and I believe that by giving women like Annociata access to loan will make great changes in their life and as well in the lives of other people around them.

 Have you ever thought about the % of persons with special needs in your country?  This idea aims to provoke how to include the citizens of special needs into the banking services. There are still too many things to improve among the banked populations regarding accessibility and if we consider among the unbanked population: how is the experience of go to a bank for a person on a wheelchair? How is it easy for a blind/deaf person search for a necessary information? How could we solve these challenges?  The lack of knowledge about special needs by society in general and managers are usually the root causes for prejudices over the persons with disabilities and the underservice of these niche. If everyone in our societies depends on money to satisfy daily needs- access to banking services is also critical for financial security. Then- it requires pay attention and understand the diverse realities and needs of the citizens to be attended.  Visiting banks in Brazil- I can see some agencies- mostly the public banks- have been concerned on accessibility issues on last years. I posted some pics attached to show some examples. But there are a lot of improvements to do! If a deaf or blind person tries to search informations about financial services in braile or in gestures/signal language- I've never seen and normally nobody at the banks knows braile and signal language.

 Recognizing the domestic working section not as helpers- but as an employment.  This idea focuses on the financial empowerment of the domestic working section in India which does not have a clear set of rules of employment laid down. It also helps in bringing a certain amount of discipline into the unorganized sector. This can be a model that can be further implemented for other working sections in the unorganized sector in India.  This idea is based on bringing the employers of the domestic workers together in acknowledging the importance of the latter and also help them in making the system transparent- thus making the workers financially stronger than they are- right now. Both the employers and the employees work for mutual benefit.  Every idea can be made successful with the right amount of confidence and perseverance.From what I have learnt- the domestic working section is mostly sidelined as the people who help and not as the ones who drive. The only way to change this- is by working with one particular domestic worker and educating her/him on the importance of their profession. By encouraging them in spreading this ideologies with their fellow workers and also at place of work- the idea will make a sound difference.  More ideas on how the domestic working section can be made more structured and transparent. Although quite a few attempts have been made at legislating the laws for the protection and financial empowerment of domestic workers- not all of them have seen the light of the day as Domestic sector is not protected under the scope of labour laws in India. Thus- brainstorming on how to make a policy level impact would be of great help.  An individual ,0,0
 Peer assisted decision making.  This idea will benefit anyone with an internet connection. From school age children right up to retirees. The idea allows an individual to review what their peers have done in a similar financial situation. Improving financial literacy among individuals and linking them to a wider community of their peers.  This idea increases the size of the community available to any individual. Peers could be located in any corner of the globe. The aim is not to direct what financial decisions should be made- but rather show what people in similar situations have done. This will improve financial knowledge in local communities leading to greater opportunities and put people in contact with a wealth of resources. Resources and opportunities grow as the (online) community grows.  Prototype the screens (desktop and mobile) to determine if the idea of social (You & Me) finance is worthy of further investigation.

 Using local shops- post offices & uniquely programmed pre-paid cards to encourage financial planning  Banks/Card issuers (eg. VISA- AMEX- etc): New audience for card usage- New install bases in small stores Square/Stripe/Paypal: Payment processingLocal stores/Small Businesses: Develop capability to accept cards- benefiting communities they serve Community members: Encourages savings and creates a saving habit Post Offices: Become the banks Governments: Encourages financial inclusion and increases money in local banks Central Banks: Key to designing the system  Community members can pre-pay to top-up their cards with a certain amount they expect to spend in the month on staples- food- and household expenses. Any leftover value can either be added to next week's/month's prepayment or added to their own savings account. The local businesses become focal points of this program since they are usually at the centre of community interactions. They exist in both large and small communities and have strong ties to the families they serve.  We can experiment this using coupons. Where families in the community buys the coupons at the start of every week or month (depending on their salary schedules) and tap in a few local stores to experiment with this project  Do you think this is this viable?How else can we prototype? How can we drive adoption among both community members and vendors? Who should own the platform- govts or banks? Would anyone be interested in testing the prototype?

 Enable communities to pool together to raise money using a single lending instrument.  Financial institutions benefit by pooling individual risks and by simplifying & reducing the underwriting process (which is costly when making individual loans). Individuals in a community benefit by receiving a portion of the loan proceeds to fund new businesses- capital purchases- or other investments. Each borrower has an obligation to pay that varies with their ability to pay and their income.  By allowing people to join together to borrow- they can reduce the consequences of failure when trying something new and innovative (like starting a new business). Lower risk aversion should result in higher-yielding investments- on average. But this innovation in financial instrument would need paired with the financial literacy and financial infrastructure concepts already proposed.  While I think there may be applications in both developed and developing communities- it may be easiest to prototype and refine this concept within the existing infrastructure of developing-world microfinance. Co-operating with Grameen or another MF institution might be the quickest route to validation and scale.  No idea is ever fully-cooked at origination; I could use the community's feedback and reframes to refine and explore this idea's range of possibilities.  An individual ,0,0

 °Mercury generates recommendations for community investment decision-making- civic resource allocation and government policy enactment.  °Mercury- a recommending intelligence engine- has the potential to benefit all communities- everywhere. Its inherent power stems from its culling of personal and sociological information to pinpoint community needs and their potential adverse effects on economies at scale. It is at its best use case when corporations and governments use its prescriptive capabilities to intelligently manage resources and invest smarter in communities.  For communities' needs to be addressed- they must first be identified. °Mercury leverages leading indicators of community health to pinpoint opportunities for smarter social investment: social influence- innovation quotients- prosperity potential- environmental impact- financial literacy- liberty- justice and reform.°Mercury also considers the strength of existing community structures- systems and values as a litmus test of positive community potential.
