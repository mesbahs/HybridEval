For the past 10 years Regen SW has been working with 300 Community Energy Groups to support them in developing their own projects. Through this work- Regen SW has encountered a number of the challenges that we will be considering in the project. Regen SW will be supporting the project with communications and promotional support as well as ensuring that any funds are properly spent and accounted for. Merlin Hyman - CEO Regen SW - Real change always comes from the bottom up- this is about celebrating the communities whose vision could just save the planet. Merlin Hyman - CEO Regen SW - Real change always comes from the bottom up- this is about celebrating the communities whose vision could just save the planet. Merlin’s reaction on being pitched the project that's bonkers: we should definitely do it KEVICC:KEVICC is the largest school in Totnes (1300 pupils) and is the home of The Ariel Centre which has a wonderful theatre space which can seat up to 300 people. The school have offered us space to develop the work and staff- students and the wider community will be involved throughout. Polly Morrow - Community Arts Coordinator'KEVICC has a long produced real quality performing arts shows and musicals- and are thrilled to think that our students might have the opportunity to collaborate with a community project such as this. Especially so as it reflects the links we have- and value- with Transition Town Totnes. It would add hugely to the students' experience and achievement and they are eager to be part of the project.'The products produced during the show will be able to be used by other groups - licenses for use of the music- script and score- films- documentary etc will be available for any group that wishes to engage people in questions about oil dependency and our future energy options - we have already identified 4 transition or community energy groups who have asked to use this material as well as an addition 8 choirs. We think that this materials will be of great help to any community groups who is dealing with these challenges.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>One of the central challenges to the development of renewables is getting consent through planning- central to this is the problem of engaging people in the energy debate in a way that is not immediately polarising or negative. We want to raise awareness of the importance of our energy choices within the greater human narrative without the direct link to a specific project to build people's confidence to engage constructively through modelling behaviours- sharing information and creating a positive experience through humour and memorable tunes.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have already worked with Matt Harvey as out poet in residence for the past 12 months producing a collection of poems which has been bought by 1300 people- performed to wide acclaim to over 8000 people in festivals and events and has recently been filmed and shared online. Poetry in general by its very nature- has a lot of hurdles to overcome (misperceptions about poetry bound and it can often seem boring to the uninitiated) Musicals tend to be more popular and this has been demonstrated with Matt and Thomas's recent show Rumpelstiltskin.We have also been trialling a variety of creative engagement tools an techniques toinvite people in to our activities and</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We arecontinually developing creative engagement techniques ad would value any inputWe want to ensure that we produce appropriate and engaging materials that attract people to use the resources that are developed in the projectWe want to ensure that we are linked to networks with an affinity to this activity and that we're aware of other activity we can learn fromWe need financial support to maximise the impact of the project</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>,5,5,4,4,5

Otherwise it will take too long for the human to adapt. Thus I decided to use motion already existing- we will soon be 9 billion on earth and imagine if only 4.5 billions would wear my clothes. Your body motion is what will provide you your own energy.</p>,2,2,2,2,3

People also hate wasting time when they can be more productive instead.We propose a one-stop place where you can do it all - run errands- buy groceries- go to the gym- mingle- meet friends and be green! Charging your EV will no longer be a painful- time-consuming and lonely affair.</p>,5,5,5,5,5

I don’t pay for power- my tenant does! I have nothing to gain!”The renter says: “I’m not going to pay tens of thousands of dollars to improve someone else’s property!”We need a solution to this problem.We need to require that leases have these kinds of profit sharing clauses for both renters and landlords.Or- create incentives for renters and landlords to sign leases like this.

Kits will be online in a wiki format so that individuals can use what's there and add their own ideas. Kits will include downloadable templates for posters- postcards- stickers- and web-ready graphics emphasizing the benefits of renewable energy- dispelling energy myths- and emphasizing the dire realities of climate change.For too long mass media and energy companies have dominated the message on climate change. Non-profits on their own have not been able to reach enough hearts and minds. We need an army of citizens to take control of the message and create change with their own guerilla-style P.S.A. campaigns!</p>,4,4,3,5,3
