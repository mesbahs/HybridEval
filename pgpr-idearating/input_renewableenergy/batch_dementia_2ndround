Here it is emptied into storage tanks or wells for later use.The system provides free renewable energy and clean water to remote areas with high rainfall anywhere in the world.The key points are that: -it can be reasonably cheap to make and easy for local communities to construct themselves. - Useful in areas that are often cloudy and solar is not particularly effective - Each tower can generate enough electricity topower lighting at a recharge station and recharge radio equipment or mobile phones for locals.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The biggest places that will benefit are those in high rainfall/monsoon regions where a lot of rain can fall for many days.

To overcome these competitors- reductions in the cost of manufacturing as well as improved efficiency and range of operating conditions need to be addressed. Hydrogen production costs and handling also will require reductions to the scale that petroleum refineries enjoy today. The Honda fuel cell FCX Clarity vehicle is rated at 59 mpg-e (mile per gallon equivalent to gasoline). If outfitted with the proposed enhanced fuel cell membranes the mileage would increase to 82.6 mpg-e.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>A report by Transparency Market Research states the global fuel cells market was valued at US$355.3 million in 2011 and is projected to grow to US$910.3 million by 2018 led by the stationary segment expected to reach a market size of $4.17 billion by 2019.The initial target market is MEA manufacturers serving the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) segment- specifically those operating at low temperature in small stationary- transportation and portable applications. The market was selected because the technology has the greatest known impact on systems operating at low temperatures. Widespread use of PEMFC technology is due to low operating temperature- rapid start up capabilities- favorable power density/size ratio and the ability to vary output in matching power demand shifts also favored selection of this market.PEMFC is the most dominant form of fuel cell- accounting for over 40% of global installed capacity and close to 88% market share in 2013. Applications include forklifts- automobiles- telecommunications- data centers- primary and backup power systems.MEA manufacturers will be critical users of the process method integrated/outsourced with their existing or potential high throughput capabilities that would drive additional cost reduction requirements of supported catalyst manufacture. Target companies also harbor relationships with PEMFC manufacturers critical in understanding industry component development needs- providing performance validation and cost reductions facilitating widespread adaption of the product.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Customer interviews identified that catalysts have to be more resistant to CO- which the technology achieves by reducing the impact of CO introduced by the ambient air supply to the operating environment.The true value resides in increased power output capabilities. For example- a 3kW fuel cell system without the enhancement costs $14-800 or $4-933/kW. With the enhancement- the system output would increase to 4.2 kW and cost $3-524/kW. This translates to fuel consumption efficiency across all applications. Using the 3 kW fuel cell example- the system consumes 39 L/min Max H2 at full power. With the enhancement the system does the same work but only consumes 23.4 L/min (40% less).</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The goal of this project is to deliver a nanoparticle enhanced membrane to a commercial MEA partner for 3rd party evaluation as to the claims and merits of this breakthrough technology.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Subject Matter Experts in the Fuel Cell Industry and others with overall interest in growing the renewable energy industry in the US.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p>,3,"A lot of people don't understand the fuel industry, so it would be hard to get people involved.",This is a really complicated idea for people to understand.,"If you could break it down in simpler terms for people, I think they would be interested.",3,3,3,3,3

Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community. We also would love to have volunteers as part of our planning or outreach teams. We welcome donations to help underwrite the cost of solutions that we are working to deploy.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>,5,"Once you get it going, I think there is no stopping this idea from being a success.",This would definitely work in certain areas.

It is a city that will be completely free from any form of fossil fuel for its power usage thereby making it a renewable energy powered city. The appealing nature of the project will create a huge demand for more of this city projects in more locations inAfrica and even the world at large.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Smart City Africa Project is beneficial to African residents and visitors from all works of life- all ages- and the location choice will focus on rural areas which are abundant in unused land areas thereby depopulating the popular cities and building new and smart cities from the revenues and products of the Pioneer smart city.Because of the comprehensive nature of the city- It will impact lives in so many waysthereby creating a smart living culture among residents of the smart city.I see a sustainable future and a city like this would be a big step to creating that sustainable future-so far I have thought of several ways to create this future- well I came up with an Idea . since it takes a huge fund to make this project a reality- I thought of drawing up a 3D design of this plan and marketing it like an off plan project which will come with a price as well as incentives. Although my target might not be the low class population but I thought of the idea of selling citizenship's to this city with a starting price of $5000 individuals to $20000 for families and at this price citizens can benefit from free health care- a housing unit and security as well as business opportunities in the city. this can be achieved because Africans yearn to live in a better environment and for that price the middle class can really benefit from this- and since the first phase of this city is to set up energy efficient production lines which would be used in construction of the city- the low class can also benefit by having massive job creations.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>As a Smart City Project- powered by renewable energy- also a production hub for manufacturing of energy efficient products- which will be used to build more smart cities across Africa- the transition will be an unconscious and automatic one. As the demand for more smart cities will increase- especially due to the affordability of energy efficient living. I would like to add some further Statistics- the most populated city in Africa Lagos is approximately 1000km2 with a population of about 20 million people and the reason for the huge population because of the amount of production going on in the city. so if a new and smart city with 3 times the land mass and over 500 energy efficient production lines and over 1000 services and small companies and businesses- there will be a huge significance in the major cities depopulation as citizens will begin to seek employment in the new city and the Smart City Africa project is looking to be home to 5 million citizens.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>A plan is all it takes. if a plan of this city is designed and awareness is being created for the Smart City Africa Project- it will attract governments- investors- banks- communities- individuals and many more fund sources to partake in the project. choosing a location for a pioneer smart city in Africa- Nigeria by population is the largest populated country in Africa with major cities like Lagos- Abuja and Port Harcourt. But the smart city best location would be the less populated locations that are close to the major cities such as Imo state- Akwa Ibom state- Cross river state etc..</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The skills required for the Smart City Africa Project idea are as many as one can imagine Architects/ designers-Engineers-Technology experts-Accountants-urban city planners-renewable energy experts- and many more experts.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>,5,"Once started up, I think it could be sustained easily.",The idea itself is a good one and I think a lot of countries should look into this.,It seems like it would take a lot of work to pull this off.,2,4,4,4,4

Consumers- financiers- and technical providers will be able to directly connect through our online social marketplace: closing the access gap to renewable energy. Whether the consumer is an individual- a school- or neighborhood- they can find the resources and options they need: banks to finance a program- a government grant for their project- or the technical experts to make it happen.Local options will be showcased- allowing each community to build and tailor their options organically.Consumers- financiers- and technical providers can post a call for proposals for a specific project or just start a conversation with potential partners.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This benefits the current and future players in the renewable energy marketplace. The way that Craigslist or eBay facilitated connections to happen by providing an online platform- we are adding an additional layer of communication to make getting renewable energy easier.Interested teachers can see the options available to their school- whether with energy providers or potential financiers. Homeowners that don't have the funds to install renewable energy can find a grant focused on this switch in their area and the company to make the switch. Addressing all needs in one marketplace - the demand- the supply- and the money - we give people the space to proactively seek solutions tailored to their needs.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Currently the available marketplaces are geared towards individual homeowners with the capital to finance such changes. This online network makes the entire idea of switching to renewable energy more accessible for a variety of different organizations and groups.This easy access- and partnerships built between technical providers and financiers- will allow the idea of switching to renewable energy easier.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We would first test the concept on a very small and localized scale. Using a lean start-up methodology of 'concierge service' where we will provide our service to a very small number of people- learn from this- iterate- and organically grow. To start- we would find 5 different types of consumers. Working exclusively with those groups/individuals- we would help them identify their best renewable energy options. Then we would reach out to current providers (and funders depending on the need) and facilitate that connection. From learning about this type of interaction with the customers- funders- and providers- we would then do a second iteration of this. During this time- we would also build a minimum viable product of a marketplace and start using this to facilitate those connections. This approach would allow us to learn and pivot accordingly.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love to hear about:- attempts to do similar partnerships- including any models to specifically show - any alternative models or financing options to complete renewable energy projects. - examples of this in other sectors - specific groups/individuals/businesseswith whom that we could test this idea out- general feedback to build on this idea- different ways to test this</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An OpenIDEO Meetup</p>,4,"With proper planning and data use, this could be a plan that works for a long while.","The easier it is to implement for people, the more willing they would be participate","Since you are putting so much effort into this, I think you are laying the groundwork for it to be a success.",4,4,4,4,4

It is an income-producing asset for an entrepreneur (just like a chicken or goat) but it is also an affordable way to buy light (and mobile phone charging) for an end-consumer. The kit consists of 2 “hockey puck” rechargeable lights/phone chargers and 1 solar panel as well as instructional information and marketing materials. We call it the “hockey puck” because it looks like a hockey puck (we’re Canadian) and contains a rechargeable battery- LED- USB phone charger. We will sell this kit to entrepreneurs who then earn income from selling recharges and an end-user now has access to clean- affordable light and energy. It's a win win.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Social: Lack of light at night restricts children’s study hours. Toxic fumes cause death. KARIBU offers children the opportunity to study at night- the family to charge their mobile phone- and eliminates toxic kerosene fumes.Environmental: The use of kerosene emits millions of tons of CO2 / year and every KARIBU solar lamp sold reduces CO2 emissions by an estimated 100kg / year.Economic: Families waste 90+ USD every year on fuel and lack of light restricts local entrepreneurs. KARIBU saves money and increases working hours for small businesses.With KARIBU- families can afford solar lighting/mobile phone charging with the benefits above. For small shops- they now have a profitable business and no longer spend money on kerosene – sunshine is free. Furthermore- money stays in the community (that formerly went to buy kerosene) and it spurs local economic development.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Solar in Africa comes with a significant up ­front cost- which is not affordable for rural populations (and it's hard to get it to them). Our approach aligns the cash flow for solar lighting and mobile phone charging with that of kerosene–making it affordable. We leverage the existing sales channel for end­-users like Alice (the small shop network) and sell them a “businesses in a box” which allows them to become profitable in a few months.In contrast to the traditional manufacturer → retailer → customer model- KARIBU provides a continuous income stream (and more jobs) for entrepreneurs vs. a one-­off sale. This approach is very conducive to rural communities that are far from towns or the electric grid and that have no mobile network reception (and it doesn't have to be constructed/nailed to a roof). Given the relatively low up ­front cost for small shops- and short payback period- the model is very scalable.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are in the early stages of launching these new kits.

The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached)</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached). We could organise building workshops- so that the people can see changes instantly.[UPDATE_FEB9TH] WORKSHOP_As it was of short notice - and we already took part in another workshop together with Otto Scharmer from Presencing institute MIT (which was great) in Berlin last Friday - we will have the workshop around the end of february. I will keep everybody involved updated on that - we will do it no matter how the idea proceeds now :-) It is amazing to see how many people are excited about this. FOR EXAMPLE_ I talked to a dear friend of mine during the Otto Scharmer workshop and we came up with an idea of combining the anaerobic digester and a filtersystem for water. He (the friend) has been in Bhutan- where pure water is a scarcity in some regions- due to lack of good canalization etc. So we are looking into possibilities of building a combination of both systems. The digester would be able to fuel the pumping-system and help the water to circulate more thoroughly. I am excited :-) [END OF UPDATE]</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Fueled by some great people here at openIDEO I am planning to pre-pone (?) the workshop on building gas-lamps out of plastic-bottles and do it in Munich or Berlin the following two weeks!

Deaths from coal mining and power plants far- far outnumber all nuclear power-related deaths.Yet archaic fact myths fuel opposition to nuclear power- which currently provides 65% of our clean energy.Nuclear is needed to address climate change in the time frame and at the scale we need.We need to remember who the real enemy is (fossil fuels and carbon emissions) and allow nuclear energy to be on the team that is working to save the planet.

Nuclear power can be designed to supplant fossil fuels now but to operate at reduced levels when not needed to support community energy needs.Nuclear makes full-implementation of renewable power feasible- since all renewable power is still intermitten in nature and is not enough by itself- such as when it rains- at night- when there is no wind- and when there is peak demand- etc. without the need to resort to burning coal.NUCLEAR POWER IS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL AND WE NEED TO ALLOW IT TO CO-EXIST UNTIL WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUT SUFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I am looking to organize a summit of environmental leaders and pro-nuclear leaderswho recognize that fossil fuels are the real enemy in our climate-threatened world.I would like this summit to air legitimate grievances with nuclear power and address realistic solutions that could enable nuclear power to regain acceptance by environmental groups as well as the broader general public.This summit should present credible experts and allow for real debate by participants.Let's be sure that we have left no stone unturned (or feasible technology unexplored) in our search for rapid solutions to our climate crisis.It would be my hope that this summit could result in a statement of acceptance of a nuclear roadmap by the collective group prior to the Paris COP- that could help provide meaningful solutions for countries seeking to make ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by 2020 and onward.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>I am calling this the Silver Bullet Summit and I need help getting financial and organizational support for this summit from foundations and non-profits and determining the key environmental leaders and experts to bring together for this life and planet-saving summit to be held in the late fall of 2015.I am at an early stage of conceptual development- and starting to prepare materials for it but I would love to have more people interested in working on this with me to make it happen.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A type of energy not listed</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>,1,"I don't see this being something that is successful, I think there are too many people who don't like nuclear energy.",I don't think people hear the word nuclear and think that it's a good thing.

We believe renewable energy should be fully integrated into to our living and working spaces as a standard option. This combined with a high efficiency building envelopes and natural water treatment systems will allow people to build new towns and cities nearly anywhere in the worldin a way that is truly sustainable. Our designs are intended to be locally manufactured and assembled in order to create jobs for these communities.For the people- by the people!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Our product is intended for a number of communities- these are as follows:The 863 million people across the world are living in slum conditions. (As of 2015). The 42 million people left homeless because of natural disasters. (2010 Figure). The 27 percent of Americans that spend more than half their income on rent. (As of 2010) The 3 billion people- or about 40 per cent of the world’s population- that will need proper housing and access to basic infrastructure by 2030- according to UN HabitatOur population is expanding at an exponential rate and the only way to achieve an acceptable standard of living for the people of this planet is through innovation. We implore you to help us with this mission.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>If renewable energy comes standard on any living or working space we build- than the need to “transition” becomes unnecessary. In addition- if these spaces are so elegant and desirable that all the surrounding communities decide they simply must have them- than you start a renewable energy movement by demand. This is a very important factor. The majority of people didn't crave electric automobiles until Tesla started making them desirable. We must combine the form of beautifully designed housing with the function on renewable energy in order to create a scaleable solution that will go viral.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Avava systems has approached the owners of a few vacant lots around the San Francisco Bay area and has received permission to do a pilot projects at these locations. This would allow us to test an initial production run of our units as well as get feedback from local users. We are also in conversation with a architecture firm that is working on sustainable work force housing for a number of projects throughout North America.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The folks at AVAVA Systems love meeting anyone who is passionate about affordable- sustainable housing. With that said- we are especially interested meeting people are working on real development projects and are open to innovative methods. We are also currently in fund raising mode- so if you or someone you know is interested in investing in “the most compelling way to build our communities” we would love to talk to them. Finally- we are always interested in talking to mechanical engineers and industrial designers.(UPDATE) One of the best things about contributing to this challenge has been the talented people that have come forward to offer their time and expertise to help us be more successful. 1. Thank you so much to Matthew Chow from the IDEO team for the help he gave us regarding our business strategy. Matthew started with a great template to evaluate our product applications. He then helped us figure out a clear and concise business plan around that application including potential partnerships- value proposition and growth strategy. Matthew's energy was inspiring and he asked some really good questions. We really appreciate the time and effort he devoted to our company.2. We have been contacted by mechanical engineer who shares our vision for creating affordable- sustainable and sexy housing solutions. We look forward to collaborating with her. We have also been contacted by a designer who is focusing on better utilizingpublic and vacant spaces- and we hope to provide him with some innovative solutions.

However- there is as yet little understanding or trust in biogas as an energy source. This idea inspired communities to use biogas by providing a live and trusted demonstration of how it works. Harnessing children's natural 'pester power' and funding a pilot community will spread the power of poo to Kyrgyzstan's rural poor and enable them to lead their country's renewables transition.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This benefits rural poor communities with livestock in Kyrgyzstan- one of DFID’s 28 priority countries. These communities live predominantly off their farming practices and have little or no access to energy. Kyrgyzstan has a high rate of literacy and we would expect the education of the target communities to be basic but with reading and writing competency. Rather than specify locations at this stage- it would be preferable to work with already established local NGOs to ensure the right pilot community is chosen- and help to build bridges to other communities.Specifically targeting the poorest families and women to become the community-employed plant maintenance operatives would help to address the additional needs of these groupings.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>These communities do not currently use renewable energy sources as uptake in Kyrgyzstan of biogas has been very limited- despite its perfect positioning for this fuel type due to its combination of livestock and an energy crisis. This is largely due to prohibitive costs and lack of understanding in communities which this idea seeks to overcome. By using the positive influencing of children and broadening this out to the whole grouping- the pilot community will recognise livestock excrement as a source of power and a solution to their energy needs.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Running a workshop with children- and a second with children and parents- to test educational methods and the power of infant influencing- will help to understand the best methods of approaching this educational phase and ascertain what branding territories might be most applicable.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Further thoughts on innovative financing mechanisms appropriate to impoverished communitiesMoney to provide the initial loan to the pilot community</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Biofuels</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>,3,It depends on a lot of circumstances.,It would depend on what the thoughts and feelings are of the people in the area.,"If people aren't interested, they aren't going to want to take part.",3,3,3,3,3

[UPDATED 7 Feb - video]</h2><p>Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount. Every time the pasteurize using our cow-poop powered system- they prevent methane emissions and make more money.Industrial milk producers - Most milk is processed at large processing plants which are huge energy hogs. We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine. Save calves through affordable milk pasteurization.Others - We are also looking at raw milk- home cheesemakers- and others.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By embedding renewables within the dairy system- we change the renewables challenge and value proposition by making it one component of an income-generating product. Users can produce more electricity than they need- so they can also retail electricity to neighbors and others.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have talked to farmers in Costa Rica- China- and the US and we think there is a real need for our product. We do not yet have FDA approval for our new technology and one question we are trying to answer is if people in under-regulated markets will accept our technology (eg. small rural farmers in emerging economies- aged cheesemakers- raw milk drinkers- others) before we go through this long process. For the US- we are testing this now. We need to ask the same of people in emerging markets.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Help us design a product that fits into the way that people make milk and manage manure now.Also- help us get perspective on our ideas about emerging market opportunities- spoilage- and on-farm milk pasteurization.

There's no doubt about that. Their favorite part of school is recess and they can't wait to get outside. What if we could use all of this energy to power places in our community- including our schools?Tiger Energy Biscuits- a Kraft company-used this same idea to build a playground. They partnered with a local university in the Philippines- working one year to create a playground that could capture energy used on the equipment to power their local community. This can be even more advanced- using other technology such as energy capturing tiles currently used at stadiums. This is a learning opportunity for kids and become cost effective for communities- and promote a school or business in the process.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The community: The cool thing about this is that it can be placed into any community.A community could plant a park- transform a park- add it to their schools- implement this into malls- theme-parks- anything! Once a community invests the time into making one- the parts and playground can be easily re-created for another location or purpose. If a city just wanted one swing set- they could just start out with that. With the money they save- they could grow their playground and their investment into even more opportunities for reusable energy.The people: Being a college student- I'm always looking for opportunities for projects like this to use my talents and make an impact- and I know I'm not the only one. Schools will want to be a part of this if it gives exposure to their university- and the opportunity for students to have a real-life experience. The kids: When I was a kid- we used to convince my teacher to give us extra recess. I know in second grade I would have so many questions of how the playground worked and why we were doing it. This could even be a fun way for schools and students to compete. They could see which class created the most energy- competing against their friends or even schools competing against schools.The city: This could create so much publicity for the city and others involved- going green is always a trend- and this is a cool way to promote it.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This idea isn't just about changing light-bulbs. This is about creating sustainable playgrounds that can power a city for years and years.Renewable energy- our focus is trying to change and develop things that already exist such as the oil industry- when we should be looking to completely new ideas (like Open IDEO is doing). If people want to have an impact on their planet- instead of waiting on someone else to change their energy- a community can start this on their own. They don't need to wait for a big company or organization- they can start making environmental change on their own!</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>1. Classes can start the discussion of energy- and start to brainstorm their own ideas and concepts for creating this renewable playground. This is the most cost effective and easiest way to see the potential of this project.2. Communities can host an even- putting things such as sustainable dance floors can be put in place to see how much energy a group of people can actually create! Their interest might start the discussion of putting this in place.http://www.sustainabledanceclub.com/products/sustainable_dance_floor/3. The company Playground Energy uses the energy from children- to create a better playground experience by adding light and sound with their energy used. Even just putting one of these items in place- you can begin to see value in the energy of kids.http://www.playgroundenergy.com/</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>This idea is good- but it can be something even greater.Post your input on how we can evolve this into something amazing!How can this playground improve your community?

Using only gravity and water- the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to rotate and follow the sun throughout the day- boostingefficiency by 30%. It also produces clean water!The SunSaluter is built from common components and is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized panel rotators (called trackers)- and is much more durable without complex components.Solar power is a proven way to alleviate energy poverty- but it is simply still too expensive for many poor consumers. By increasing efficiency and lowering the overall cost per watt- the SunSaluter can help communities afford the transition to clean energy!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The SunSaluter is ideal for poor- rural individuals living without electricity. These individuals earn just dollars a day and often spend more than 20% of their income on kerosene gas and walk hours just to charge their cell phones. Solar energy is a great tool for eliminating these problems- but it is often still too expensive up-front for them. By boosting efficiency and lowering the cost per watt of solar energy- the SunSaluter brings solar energy within reach. For example- a 150 watt solar lantern charging station which powers 75 lanterns can be outfitted with a SunSaluter to be capable of charging 25 more lanterns. The individuals living in unelectrified communities also often lack access to clean water- so the SunSaluter provides a great additional benefit.For example- at the OneMama Clinic in Kirindi- Uganda- a SunSaluter installation has allowed women at the health clinic to not only eliminate the usage of kerosene- but to create a phone charging business to bolster their income.“The mamas are so excited that this is bringing light into an area where they spend the most time- which is in the Kitchen area- and also bringing energy for them to charge cell phones and purifying water- so we’re using it for tea and for cooking dinner. The OneMama Clinic is very grateful to SunSaluter for bringing its wonderful technology to the OneMama Clinic and to Uganda.”- Siobhan Neilland- Founder of OneMama</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>By boosting the efficiency of solar panels by 30%- the SunSaluter lowers the overall cost per watt of solar energy and simply makes it more affordable. Excellent solar technology is already available in many markets - but cost is still a primary barrier to widespread adoption. The SunSaluter is also unique in that it be installed with new solar systems or used to retrofit existing systems. With over 2 gigawatts of off-grid solar capacity currently installed worldwide- the solar infrastructure upon which to use the SunSaluter already exists- and is growing every day. The SunSaluter is simple to build and requires no special equipment nor training- meaning any community can adopt it rapidly. Lastly- if we can get local entrepreneurs to manufacture and distribute their own SunSaluters- costs will decrease dramatically and hopefully instill confidence in the community to adopt the technology.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have already deployed over 100 SunSaluters around the world - and every time we learn something new! Regarding outsourced manufacturing- we are beginning to work with a village in northern India where the locals will build their own SunSaluters and can either use them- sell them- or resell them back to us to provide our other customers. We will be making at least 30 systems with them in the coming months- and would really love to learn how to make the process beneficial to everyone involved. We are happy to try any suggestions that people have. And of course we're open to trying this approach with other partners around the world!</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would be grateful for any recommendations on how to set up a human-centered manufacturing and distribution partnership with these communities. What can we do to make sure it is beneficial to the community members- but also ensure standards of quality and reliability for us? What should we make sure not to do? Are there any partner organizations that you recommend that we work with? And of course- any technical or design suggestions are always welcome too - thank you!</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>,5,"Once implemented, I don't think there would be anything in the way of using them.",Most people would want to try out solar panels in order to help out the environment.,"I don't know how you'd keep the cost of the panels low, I think most people don't use them because of the cost.",3,4,4,4,4

Everybody cooks- everybody fries. And so everybody has leftover used cooking oil and in many cases does not know what to do with it. Only ahandful of countries have a working used kitchen oil collection program and the awareness is still very low. In third world countries and developing countries- often such oil isn't disposed properly because there are simply no means of doing so. By implementing a collection system in such countries- we not only protect the environment a little more- we also help to produce biofuels that can be reused over and over again as it is done in the UK for example.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This program would target local communities of Latin American countries where there is no working used oil collection system. Even if there is two restaurants that somehow recycle their used oil or dispose it relatively safely- the remaining fifty will pour the oil down the drain- which will clog the pipes of the entire building- street- neighborhood- city... Except for the local communities- this will be an initiative for those who are interested in using biofuels in order to either protect the environment- be more cost effective- or both.Strongly suggested would be to target children from elementary school- through high school to university by directly involving them in the program. Why? Simply because the future starts with the children. Educating them about biofuels will ensure their eco-responsibility standards to be higher. And how would this be done? The youngest ones could simply collect used cooking oil from their mom's kitchen and bring it to school that will then hand it over to the collection site. In the case of older children/teenagers- they could participate in the site collection directly as an extra curriculum activity.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Used cooking oil is a very fast way to obtain biofuels. It is everywhere and there is an abundance of it.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The first step in Bogota would be to simply do an on-site research.

While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community.

Here it is emptied into storage tanks or wells for later use.The system provides free renewable energy and clean water to remote areas with high rainfall anywhere in the world.The key points are that: -it can be reasonably cheap to make and easy for local communities to construct themselves. - Useful in areas that are often cloudy and solar is not particularly effective - Each tower can generate enough electricity topower lighting at a recharge station and recharge radio equipment or mobile phones for locals.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The biggest places that will benefit are those in high rainfall/monsoon regions where a lot of rain can fall for many days. During the rainy season heavy cloud cover can mean very little sunlight for effective solar panel use. Areas that have no electricity supply at all will benefit the most.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We need to be able to use mathematical/physics models to see how much rain water needs to be collected to generate certain amounts of electricity.

We raise money through crowdfunding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations and worker-owned cooperatives.As these organizations pay us back- we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.It's a pay-it-forward model for community solar.We call it the Solar Seed Fund.Learn more at www.solarseedfund.org and www.re-volv.org!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The Solar Seed Fund benefits everyone by helping nonprofits and cooperatives that serve their community go solar. The avoided carbon emissions help alleviate climate change- and seeing solar panels on the rooftops of beloved community organizations inspires community members to go solar at home. But even if someone can't go solar at home- they can chip in and support the Solar Seed Fund and know that they are actively creating climate solutions. Every dollar donated is a vote for a clean energy future.Small community-based nonprofits and cooperatives often want to go solar to save money and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. However- due to their tax structure- credit rating- and the size of their projects- they often can’t find solar financing.RE-volv makes going solar easier for these organizations by offering low-cost financing through hassle-free lease agreements. In addition- through RE-volv's educational outreach programs- these community organizations are helping to raise awareness about solar energy among the people they serve.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>RE-volv’s main objective is to implement renewable energy projects in communities that can’t afford them. Nonprofits and cooperatives that serve as the backbone of our communities are often left without financing options for solar energy. Through its revolving fund model- RE-volv is able to provide access to solar to those who previously didn’t have it.RE-volv’s programs are uniquely designed to increase civic participation. Traditional solar financing comes from a few big banks and financial institutions. RE-volv turns this model on its head.RE-volv gives every single person the ability to help support building local solar projects. This way- each person can take action on climate change and participate in creating a more sustainable community.Through this community participatory finance model- RE-volv creates localized- renewable power generation and green jobs through its solar installations.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>So far- we've crowdfunded two projects successfully and are currently in the middle of our third crowdfunding campaign. You can check it out at www.solarseedfund.org! Lease payments from the first two projects have lowered the amount we need to crowdfund for our current project by $7-008. Soon we will launch our own crowdfunding platform giving donors the ability to view a portfolio of the projects they’ve supported and the environmental impact they’ve had. With the new platform we’ll be experimenting with functionality to find out what are the key features to foster engagement on the site.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We need to expand the Solar Seed Fund network and take our model to scale.

To overcome these competitors- reductions in the cost of manufacturing as well as improved efficiency and range of operating conditions need to be addressed. Hydrogen production costs and handling also will require reductions to the scale that petroleum refineries enjoy today.

The market was selected because the technology has the greatest known impact on systems operating at low temperatures. Widespread use of PEMFC technology is due to low operating temperature- rapid start up capabilities- favorable power density/size ratio and the ability to vary output in matching power demand shifts also favored selection of this market.PEMFC is the most dominant form of fuel cell- accounting for over 40% of global installed capacity and close to 88% market share in 2013. Applications include forklifts- automobiles- telecommunications- data centers- primary and backup power systems.MEA manufacturers will be critical users of the process method integrated/outsourced with their existing or potential high throughput capabilities that would drive additional cost reduction requirements of supported catalyst manufacture.

Current solar owners will be invited to an appreciation event in which they will be given greater insight into the vision of what a world with clean energy will look like. This event- co-hosted by non-profits and solar companies- will help each solar owner engage their close social networks to share this vision- opening with the simple question How can we better improve our neighborhood and invite their neighbors- friends- family and colleagues to a block party exploring their collection of ideas- with solar as one of the suggestions to explore.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The main players are suburban neighborhoods- solar companies and non-profits working to discover the needs of a community. Through this program- community stakeholders- like local businesses- city councils and schools- can be included overtime as ideas for neighborhood improvements arise from the opportunity events. For example- in my own community- a high concern is crime and a great solution that does not require added financial investment is engaging neighbors in starting a neighborhood watch. This has already happened in certain parts of our city- but is not universally practiced. Ironically- it is a simple invitation to an event and a willing host that sparks solution in communities and engages citizens into the development of a community. Going solar can become associated with a neighborhood that is well-connect and united in their values. Truly- while going solar initially has been a greatbenefit to individuals families- as the movement builds- it can be seen as an unexpected catalyst for change.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Their choice to going solar turns into them becoming invited into a greater movement- getting to know their neighbors- and gaining a new sense of purpose and hope for their community. This choice creates a greater push force in our communities to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. We no longer see it as a choice for us to make individually- but an opportunity for us to rediscover our shared challenges- opportunities and values.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>As current solar employees and knowing several solar customers- we can enroll these customers into the idea and engage non-profits about the idea for the program. Finding a small suburban neighborhood with a high density of customers- at least 20 people who have gone solar-to pilot this program is possible. At first- the events will have to be provided by the employees and non-profit- but as long as we provide and track data about the rate of conversion to solar around the homes in the neighborhood- it could possibly start a pilot program that successfully creates the transition of solar systems to a retail product to an entry point towards a movement. This idea was sparked by a conversation among solar sales employees who want to try new ways in engaging the customer base and overcoming our greatest obstacles. This pilot program is meant to diversify the strategies and types of interactions that motivate people to going solar. California is at the forefront of solar with the recent announcement from Jerry Brown with the states commitment to 50% renewable energy generation by 2030. We envision this program to begin in the suburban areas of Los Angeles County- where cities are small in population and the population is highly diverse.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Collaboration from non-profits with presentations they already use to engage people about the positive vision of what renewable energy and solar can mean for our communities. Insight from current solar companies of the financial resources they can convert towards a pilot program or third-party non-profit that can test this idea.

We transfer technology and build capacity by establishing local partnerships that manufacture- own and operate novel distributed renewable energy infrastructure to provide an affordable distributed utility service to rural areas. There are many companies that offer energy products to off-grid communities but we represent something different: a micro-utility- a full scale replacement for a 24/7 reliable electrical grid- specifically for areas that the conventional grid may never reach.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The lack of electricity infrastructure is especially apparent in rural communities. According to estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA)- only 14% of people living in rural Africa have access to electricity. This crucial infrastructure is needed by private households and it is essential as a multiplier for the effectiveness of institutions such as schools and health clinics that can otherwise only offer a bare minimum of services to their communities. Especially in regard to health institutions- the need for electricity is well understood: specialized medical diagnostic and treatment equipment (x-ray machines- blood analyzers- etc.)- computers- Electronic Medical Recordkeeping (EMR)- and telemedicine programs all depend on electricity. Supporting loads such as lighting (for increased hours of operation and security)- storage of medicines and vaccines- and the powering of staff quarters (which has implications for the attraction and retention of qualified professionals to work in remote areas)- are also basic requirements for effective health care.In addition to electricity- thermal energy plays a vital role for operations and hygiene in the form of cooling or heating the clinic facility and the providing of hot water – an aspect often overlooked in electrification programs. Common sense indicates that clinics and schools cannot operate effectively if the temperature rises above 90°F or drops below 50 °F- but little is currently done to systematically manage climate extremes when planning infrastructure upgrades.Based on published data- STG estimates that there are 80-000 health clinics and 260-000 schools worldwide that currently operate without electricity. The total value of this market is US $4.5B. To put the global market size in context- in Africa alone the market for diesel generators has been consistently growing at 30% per annum since 2006 and exceeded US $1 billion in 2007. This figure of course belies the real cost of diesel power generation- since the annual cost of fuel consumed by the installed base of generators is an order of magnitude greater than the annual capital investment- with estimates ranging between US$10-50 billion.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Most off-grid communities in developing countries are dependent on kerosene lamps for lighting as well as batteries and diesel generators for powering basic appliances. The lack of proper access to energy sources forces communities to pay very high prices for electricity use despite the fact that most of these villages lie in areas with ideal resources for implementing affordable solar energy systems. STG’s approach is to help communities to bridge the gap between the feasibility of using renewable energy systems and the high capital cost that prevents their implementation with specialized off-grid technology and an innovative partnership model.Additionally- one of our core beliefs is that sustainability can only be secured in the long-term if the communities actively participate in the electrification process. Next to technology transfer and training of local employees- it is of great importance to us to not deliver our energy systems as a black box- but to invite members of the community to learn about the technology and to incorporate their suggestions into our design process at an early stage.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>STG International was founded on the basis of our experiences as volunteers in Lesotho- Africa. Throughout our work- we were able to gain extensive knowledge of the needs of underserved communities and therefore identified the lack of access to electricity as one of the main obstacles that stands in the way of delivering adequate education and healthcare as well as the building of infrastructure needed for economic development. After founding STG and designing our technology- we installed our first energy system at Matjoto health clinic in Lesotho. Over the course of this process- we established a local subsidiary- STG Lesotho- with several full-time employees- and cooperated with the Lesotho government to offer training and educational courses to students and the local population. The first installation of our energy system enabled us to gain valuable experiences on how to optimize our business plan and our technology. Based on these experiences- we feel confident to move to the next step and install our first- village-scale pilot systems to test and further advance our approach and our energy systems.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One of the main reasons why we would like to become a member of OpenIDEO is its focus on community. Throughout our work in developing countries- we have seen that many projects are well-intended- but fail to succeed because the local population is not included in the process of finding and designing solutions to their pressing problems.STG’s approach is to put the community first and ask the local population about which services they need and how these services should be structured. Therefore- we look forward to sharing our approach with the OpenIDEO community and look forward to any suggestions- ideas or recommendations on how we can improve our technology and our interaction with communities.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Student Collaboration</p>","4","We need funds to do this - a world agency should be in charge.","Most people would like to help others even if they do not directly benefit from the idea.","United Nations agency should be influenced since this idea would be good for the entire world.","4","4","4"

Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community. We also would love to have volunteers as part of our planning or outreach teams. We welcome donations to help underwrite the cost of solutions that we are working to deploy.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","5","It doesn’t seem to be a huge financial blow back from this it’s actually going to create incentives and more financial rewards as well as environmental rewards for the bay area.

Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community. We also would love to have volunteers as part of our planning or outreach teams. We welcome donations to help underwrite the cost of solutions that we are working to deploy.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","4","Once implemented it would be viable though there would be maintenance and upgrade costs.","It is desirable to make cities more energy efficient.","I am not really sure if there is enough backing to cover this by 2050.","3","3","3"

We also work closely with local community organizations and financial institutions- mobile money service providers- and solar power system designers and manufacturers.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Solar power is available- affordable and reliable – the obstacles lie in financing and distribution for under-electrified rural communities. Our model empowers local women to become a part of our solar distribution franchise and sustainably deliver power to the last mile. With the convenience of mobile payments paired with mobile-controlled systems- EG entrepreneurs can offer customers high-quality- efficient solar power systems for their homes in exchange for monthly payments. With mobile money- entrepreneurs and agents will be able to collect monthly payments easily even when customers are hard-to-reach.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We are ready to pilot our PAYG solar-home-system and mobile payment platform within our existing distribution network of 7 women-led solar businesses and expand it to our 2015 class of 10 entrepreneurs later this year. With an expanded customer base- more enterprises and a mobile marketing campaign EG will be able to build on our existing model of women-led distributed energy services to offer more customers more power and appliances with built-in financing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>•Mobile money + telecommunications partners/advisors•App/backend software developers/advisors•Consumer electronics specialists to help us integrate PAYG technology- solar power components and appliances into a compelling package •PAYG technology sourcing partners•Training programs for solar installation/maintenance partners/advisors •Customer Financing/Impact investment/Program-Related-Investment</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","4","Once implemented then this should be able to continue to grow","I think women around the world would want to back this idea.","It may require a lot of planning and marketing to implement.","3","5","4"

An ideal community for these trees could be Chicago - a city that combines affordability with desirability. Having wind- budget and taste for art- the city of Chicago is a great place to ‘plant’ these trees.However- we should not limit to windy cities- since these trees can work with very soft breezes (4mph). Considering that 88% of the US consumers prefer to use renewable electricity- these trees can work in basically any urban setting.People could use these trees for their community activities- taking advantage of the energy generated. Another key players are Universities. Students can gather around these Trees to study and do their activities.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This Tree is the first real possibility to generate wind energy within a city on a large scale. By surpassing the three previously mentioned barriers- it helps communities rapidly transition to renewables.The more Giving Trees we ‘plant’ the more green energy will grow- replacing fossil fuels consumption. Having them on public spaces will also generate awareness of this issue.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The original Wind Tree has been prototyped three times in France and during the upcoming months will launch to the market at a price of €29-500. Prototyping the Giving Tree as a whole won’t be cheap nor lightweight. But we could apply a more user-centered approach- checking out how people react to the aesthetics and uses of this tree- even though it’s not actually generating energy. After talking and surveying my classmates at Chicago Booth- I found out that not many would walk into the park just to sit next to this tree... but if the tree was located next to the (football) field then it would be really useful- both for them and for the people watching</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>What other community activities could be done around these trees?

An ideal community for these trees could be Chicago - a city that combines affordability with desirability. Having wind- budget and taste for art- the city of Chicago is a great place to ‘plant’ these trees.However- we should not limit to windy cities- since these trees can work with very soft breezes (4mph). Considering that 88% of the US consumers prefer to use renewable electricity- these trees can work in basically any urban setting.People could use these trees for their community activities- taking advantage of the energy generated. Another key players are Universities. Students can gather around these Trees to study and do their activities.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This Tree is the first real possibility to generate wind energy within a city on a large scale. By surpassing the three previously mentioned barriers- it helps communities rapidly transition to renewables.The more Giving Trees we ‘plant’ the more green energy will grow- replacing fossil fuels consumption. Having them on public spaces will also generate awareness of this issue.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The original Wind Tree has been prototyped three times in France and during the upcoming months will launch to the market at a price of €29-500. Prototyping the Giving Tree as a whole won’t be cheap nor lightweight. But we could apply a more user-centered approach- checking out how people react to the aesthetics and uses of this tree- even though it’s not actually generating energy. After talking and surveying my classmates at Chicago Booth- I found out that not many would walk into the park just to sit next to this tree... but if the tree was located next to the (football) field then it would be really useful- both for them and for the people watching</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>What other community activities could be done around these trees? This idea has been growing faster after different brainstorming sessions we had with Natalie (see attached pic)- if anyone is interested in joining the next session just let us know!</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Wind</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","5","I think, if it could pass the safety and scientific testing, this could be a workable method of generating energy. Windfarms are already successful, but take up too much room. Solving this problem could open up a new generation of wind power.","Wind energy has proven effective in many parts of the world, even the ocean. Having one ""tree"" instead of a whole windfarm allows it to be placed in urban areas.","Windfarms have received significant pushback, however one ""tree"" vs a whole field may help solve this problem. The design would need to be efficient, though, and have proven scientific backing showing that its not harmful to wildlife or humans.","4","5","4"

UPDATE Feb 9</h2><p>Communities can make themselves independent by using their daily waste to produce energy.[UPDATE_FEB1ST] In Germany there is a community of 180 people nearby Berlin which are completely autarc from national power-plants. Read their story below![UPDATE_FEB9TH] Thanks to the great help of Emily from IDEO- who got inspired by the idea- we now have a beautiful visual to help understand the simplicity of the small homemade anaerobic digester (micro-biogas-plant) >> Check it out :-)</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea can benefit any kind of community that produces waste. The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached)</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached).

UPDATE Feb 9</h2><p>Communities can make themselves independent by using their daily waste to produce energy.[UPDATE_FEB1ST] In Germany there is a community of 180 people nearby Berlin which are completely autarc from national power-plants. Read their story below![UPDATE_FEB9TH] Thanks to the great help of Emily from IDEO- who got inspired by the idea- we now have a beautiful visual to help understand the simplicity of the small homemade anaerobic digester (micro-biogas-plant) >> Check it out :-)</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea can benefit any kind of community that produces waste. The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached)</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached).

Deaths from coal mining and power plants far- far outnumber all nuclear power-related deaths.Yet archaic fact myths fuel opposition to nuclear power- which currently provides 65% of our clean energy.Nuclear is needed to address climate change in the time frame and at the scale we need.We need to remember who the real enemy is (fossil fuels and carbon emissions) and allow nuclear energy to be on the team that is working to save the planet. We may even like 4th generation new nukes!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea benefits everyone because it hurts fossil fuels.Individuals and community leaders should demand that local and national environment groups accept nuclear as a part of the necessary transition to clean energy as a solution to climate change.Listen to the many experts who support nuclear and stop trying to close nuclear power plants. Instead demand more accountability from federal regulators and regional power industry professionals.Evaluate new nuclear technologies and learn the real facts : don't allow myths to make you harbor unrealistic fear of something that you have a near zero risk of injury from.Work together to support smart nuclear policies to help diminish the economic and political power of hostile fossil fuel interests- who are successfully buying our elections and holding our politicians hostage.With every nuclear power plant that staying in operation- re-opens or is built- we keep oil and gas from replacing that energy and force oil and gas to keep those fossil fuels in the ground- where they are needed.By the way- here is a list (created by the Breakthrough Institute plus some) of people who already support the need for more nuclear power.President Barack Obama-Ansel Adams-Paul Allen-Steward Brand-Sir Richard Branson- The Breakthrough Institute-Carol Browner-Dr. Stephen Chu-Gwyneth Cravens-The Dalai Lama-Jared Diamond-Senator Al Franken-Bill Gates-Dr. James Hansen-John Holdren-Dr. James Lovelock-Dr. Jane Long-Mark Lynas-George Monbiot-Hugh Montefiore-Richard Rhodes-Jeffrey Sachs-Stephen Tindale-. . . and many more</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This idea empowers communities to aggressively seek renewable energy while also having as back-up a clean energy source that reliability backs up their renewable power.Currently our major source of reliableback-up power is coal and gas.Dependable energy storage is still a long ways off. Nuclear power can be designed to supplant fossil fuels now but to operate at reduced levels when not needed to support community energy needs.Nuclear makes full-implementation of renewable power feasible- since all renewable power is still intermitten in nature and is not enough by itself- such as when it rains- at night- when there is no wind- and when there is peak demand- etc. without the need to resort to burning coal.NUCLEAR POWER IS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL AND WE NEED TO ALLOW IT TO CO-EXIST UNTIL WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUT SUFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I am looking to organize a summit of environmental leaders and pro-nuclear leaderswho recognize that fossil fuels are the real enemy in our climate-threatened world.I would like this summit to air legitimate grievances with nuclear power and address realistic solutions that could enable nuclear power to regain acceptance by environmental groups as well as the broader general public.This summit should present credible experts and allow for real debate by participants.Let's be sure that we have left no stone unturned (or feasible technology unexplored) in our search for rapid solutions to our climate crisis.It would be my hope that this summit could result in a statement of acceptance of a nuclear roadmap by the collective group prior to the Paris COP- that could help provide meaningful solutions for countries seeking to make ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by 2020 and onward.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>I am calling this the Silver Bullet Summit and I need help getting financial and organizational support for this summit from foundations and non-profits and determining the key environmental leaders and experts to bring together for this life and planet-saving summit to be held in the late fall of 2015.I am at an early stage of conceptual development- and starting to prepare materials for it but I would love to have more people interested in working on this with me to make it happen.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A type of energy not listed</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","2","I think that we have to shift to energy other than coal and nuclear.","People are still hesitant to adopt nuclear energy as nuclear energy can be harmful to people in the vicinity of it if not maintained properly, so a lot of convincing would have to be done.","It is possible to implement this though there would be a lot of protest","3","2","3"

Deaths from coal mining and power plants far- far outnumber all nuclear power-related deaths.Yet archaic fact myths fuel opposition to nuclear power- which currently provides 65% of our clean energy.Nuclear is needed to address climate change in the time frame and at the scale we need.We need to remember who the real enemy is (fossil fuels and carbon emissions) and allow nuclear energy to be on the team that is working to save the planet. We may even like 4th generation new nukes!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea benefits everyone because it hurts fossil fuels.Individuals and community leaders should demand that local and national environment groups accept nuclear as a part of the necessary transition to clean energy as a solution to climate change.Listen to the many experts who support nuclear and stop trying to close nuclear power plants. Instead demand more accountability from federal regulators and regional power industry professionals.Evaluate new nuclear technologies and learn the real facts : don't allow myths to make you harbor unrealistic fear of something that you have a near zero risk of injury from.Work together to support smart nuclear policies to help diminish the economic and political power of hostile fossil fuel interests- who are successfully buying our elections and holding our politicians hostage.With every nuclear power plant that staying in operation- re-opens or is built- we keep oil and gas from replacing that energy and force oil and gas to keep those fossil fuels in the ground- where they are needed.By the way- here is a list (created by the Breakthrough Institute plus some) of people who already support the need for more nuclear power.President Barack Obama-Ansel Adams-Paul Allen-Steward Brand-Sir Richard Branson- The Breakthrough Institute-Carol Browner-Dr. Stephen Chu-Gwyneth Cravens-The Dalai Lama-Jared Diamond-Senator Al Franken-Bill Gates-Dr. James Hansen-John Holdren-Dr. James Lovelock-Dr. Jane Long-Mark Lynas-George Monbiot-Hugh Montefiore-Richard Rhodes-Jeffrey Sachs-Stephen Tindale-. . . and many more</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>This idea empowers communities to aggressively seek renewable energy while also having as back-up a clean energy source that reliability backs up their renewable power.Currently our major source of reliableback-up power is coal and gas.Dependable energy storage is still a long ways off. Nuclear power can be designed to supplant fossil fuels now but to operate at reduced levels when not needed to support community energy needs.Nuclear makes full-implementation of renewable power feasible- since all renewable power is still intermitten in nature and is not enough by itself- such as when it rains- at night- when there is no wind- and when there is peak demand- etc. without the need to resort to burning coal.NUCLEAR POWER IS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL AND WE NEED TO ALLOW IT TO CO-EXIST UNTIL WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUT SUFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I am looking to organize a summit of environmental leaders and pro-nuclear leaderswho recognize that fossil fuels are the real enemy in our climate-threatened world.I would like this summit to air legitimate grievances with nuclear power and address realistic solutions that could enable nuclear power to regain acceptance by environmental groups as well as the broader general public.This summit should present credible experts and allow for real debate by participants.Let's be sure that we have left no stone unturned (or feasible technology unexplored) in our search for rapid solutions to our climate crisis.It would be my hope that this summit could result in a statement of acceptance of a nuclear roadmap by the collective group prior to the Paris COP- that could help provide meaningful solutions for countries seeking to make ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by 2020 and onward.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>I am calling this the Silver Bullet Summit and I need help getting financial and organizational support for this summit from foundations and non-profits and determining the key environmental leaders and experts to bring together for this life and planet-saving summit to be held in the late fall of 2015.I am at an early stage of conceptual development- and starting to prepare materials for it but I would love to have more people interested in working on this with me to make it happen.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A type of energy not listed</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","3","I am sure it it is not as bad as other things it will holds since it has been proven to work.","I am not sure of the emissions or toxins that go with nuclear power.","I am sure it can be done the work has been done we are just talking expansion here.","4","3","4"

Power is essential for emergency response operations involving communications- fire and police stations- command and control centers- hospitals- water and sewer plants- water pumping- elevators- fuel pumps- medical equipment- refrigeration- heating- and for so many other types critical- electronic equipment. Solar plus energy storage for critical community facilities—fire- police- emergency shelters- as well as power protection for affordable and elderly housing facilities—is the technology innovation with the greatest potential to expand community-based renewable power to scale across the US in the years ahead.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>All members of a community can benefit from distributed- resilient power solutions like solar+storage located at critical facilities and community shelters. Other who could benefit are vulnerable populations including the disabled- elderly and the poor- if resilient power solutions are incorporated into their buildings and facilities. If these facilities remain “powered” during a long duration power outage- residents will not have to be moved- their ability to charge medical and mobility devices will remain- refrigeration and heating systems will be powered- and they could ride out the outage by sheltering in place. As communities start to prepare of the effects of climate change and energy assurance- the ability to deploy clean- reliable- renewable energy solutions should be at the top of the list. How and where solar+storage technologies can keep emergency management and response systems powered should be incorporated into new community planning discussions and resilience plans.In a blueprint for how a community could become more “power resilient-” Clean Energy Group produced a report- Clean Energy for Resilient Communities- which shows how the City of Baltimore and other cities could use clean energy to create a more reliable electric system that protects vulnerable citizens during power blackouts. The report is the first in-depth review of national policies and finance strategies to use solar and energy storage to provide more power protection in an urban setting. The report says that critical public facilities like hospitals- fire stations- gas stations- community shelters- and schools should use more resilient power technologies to protect people during power outages. The report also recommends new business models and highlights the emergence of companies that now sell solar with battery storage services to customers—to address the overlooked problem of stand-alone PV systems not working during power outages. See http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/2014-Files/Clean-Energy-for-Resilient-Communities-Report-Feb2014.pdf.In order for this transition to succeed- community leaders need more information about how these technologies will work and how they can finance them. Developers need to understand how to incorporate these technologies into their plans and how to communicate the benefits to communities. As communities- such as those in Massachusetts- start to deploy solar+storage technologies- Clean Energy Group needs to work find out what challenges they faced- how they overcame those challenges- and then provide these lessons-learned to other communities who are moving in the same direction.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>Installations of solar+storage technologies can accelerate renewable energy markets. If more communities install solar+storage technologies in place of diesel generators- more resilient- clean and reliable power will be provided during power outages. If these systems are sized to provide power to larger loads all of the time- communities will decrease their reliance on fossil fuels and drive the market demand for solar and storage technologies. This increased demand should result in lower costs as these markets achieve scale. The more renewable energy technologies are deployed- the greater our ability to meet the challenges of climate change. As a society- the move the domestic- distributed energy production in renewable energy will also have economic- health- and other societal benefits at the local and national level. What many people who install gird-connected solar PV equipment on their homes fail to realize is that in most cases- if the grid goes down- there solar panels can no longer supply electricity to their homes. With solar+storage systems- additional equipment is deployed that would allow the home to disconnect from the grid during a power outage and continue to generate power that the homeowner can use. The same goes for business and other facilities. Adding storage to a system moves the solar equipment to a new level – with the ability to provide power during an outage.With steadily dropping costs in both solar and energy storage technologies- solar+storage has become a viable and more reliable choice for emergency power. Not only do solar+storage systems have the ability to provide power indefinitely when the grid is unavailable- they can also cut costs and generate revenue during the 99.9% of the time when the grid is functioning normally. In many cases- these savings and revenue streams can drastically reduce the payback period of an energy storage system. These technologies can provide clean energy- possible revenues- and more energy security to communities. As part of the Resilient Power Project- Clean Energy Group has created a small technical assistance fund to help communities analyze these options as part of our Resilient Power Project- with funding from several foundations. But the demand is great to work with more communities across the country. In addition- to get to scale- new forms of financing mechanisms are needed to aggregate projects and bring in lower cost capital to reduce project costs for communities. Our Resilient Power Project is addressing the challenges to widespread deployment of these technologies. We have recently published a report- “Financing for Resilient Power Solutions” that can be downloaded at http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/CEG-Financing-for-Resilient-Power.pdf. Solar+storage is a hybrid innovation that benefits customers directly- so it is not dependent solely on the environmental attributes of the technology- but rather follows the “disruptive technology” path of cheaper- smaller and more effective technologies that will upset the established grid status quo more rapidly than a pure subsidy based model.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Clean Energy Group is working with leading community developers to install these technologies now in affordable housing communities across the country. We have a special interest in multifamily housing for low income and elderly residents- as well as assisted living and supportive housing and community facilities.We are beginning to see multifamily projects develop clean distributed generation combined with storage (resilient power) to protect low-income and vulnerable populations from extreme weather-related power outages that can last for weeks at a time.We are not a developer or finance institution. But we work with those entities- and we provide technical services and possible funding for predevelopment costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects. In addition to providing support to developers of affordable multifamily housing and community facilities- we are working with local agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in low income communities throughout extended power disruptions.Clean Energy Group is also working to create a network of state and municipal officials across the country to address climate adaptation and resilience. We are partnering with state agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in communities throughout extended power disruptions.We and our partners can help state energy assurance planners to craft policy through our information sharing- best practices and research- and by sharing our experience and contacts. Clean Energy Group can also provides technical services and some funding for pre-development costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love working with the OpenIDEO community on clean energy deployment and an information sharing platform to distribute our free reports- concept notes- webinars and newsletters on resilient power to those who would be interested in that information.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","5","I’m not sure because there’s going to be a lot of money involved in this.

Solar+storage is a hybrid innovation that benefits customers directly- so it is not dependent solely on the environmental attributes of the technology- but rather follows the “disruptive technology” path of cheaper- smaller and more effective technologies that will upset the established grid status quo more rapidly than a pure subsidy based model.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Clean Energy Group is working with leading community developers to install these technologies now in affordable housing communities across the country. We have a special interest in multifamily housing for low income and elderly residents- as well as assisted living and supportive housing and community facilities.We are beginning to see multifamily projects develop clean distributed generation combined with storage (resilient power) to protect low-income and vulnerable populations from extreme weather-related power outages that can last for weeks at a time.We are not a developer or finance institution. But we work with those entities- and we provide technical services and possible funding for predevelopment costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects. In addition to providing support to developers of affordable multifamily housing and community facilities- we are working with local agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in low income communities throughout extended power disruptions.Clean Energy Group is also working to create a network of state and municipal officials across the country to address climate adaptation and resilience. We are partnering with state agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in communities throughout extended power disruptions.We and our partners can help state energy assurance planners to craft policy through our information sharing- best practices and research- and by sharing our experience and contacts. Clean Energy Group can also provides technical services and some funding for pre-development costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love working with the OpenIDEO community on clean energy deployment and an information sharing platform to distribute our free reports- concept notes- webinars and newsletters on resilient power to those who would be interested in that information.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>A combination of various types of renewable energy</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A Group Brainstorm</p>","5","Solar power might be viable in certain states only, such as Arizona.","Most people like to help others.

It allows users to- at a glance- see a live reading of your usage by converting your kilowatts to currency; compare usage with similar households (based on individual user profiles- linked to social media etc); and allows for deeper insights into possible energy savings with alternative providers/sources (based on neighbour usage).</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>It is designed to be used across the whole community- irrespective of social-economic status- including education and financial situation. By designing an app that can be used on a smartphone- computer or smart TV- we are able to cover large sections of the community. We are seeking to capitalise on the abundance of data available already from our smart meters to better inform the consumer about making renewable energy choices.Open source development would be an ideal way to roll out a testing stage of this app.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The Power Portal empowers the consumer through transparency and knowledge about there energy usage by promoting an organic switch to renewable sources.In turn- this creates a groundswell of community understanding and agency- which can be used to put pressure on big business. After all- if there is enough demand- the bigger power businesses will feel the pressure to stay relevant to there market. This will drive a rapid change in delivering renewable power to your doorstep.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Stage 1 By gaining access to the Smart meter we can quickly and easily see users consumption instantly. We then need to make sense of this data and convert it into meaningful graphics/visualsthat are easy to understand.Stage 2 Taking theinformation from the users bill and the the energy companies Kilowatt usage costs. We can start to build a picture of what the live cost of the households consumption is right away.

In today’s world of mobile technology and rechargeable batteries- people don’t necessarily need electricity delivered to their home - they need a battery charged. By providing lockers at a station- members of the community can drop off their device (or battery) for charging- and feel confident that their property will be secure and charged reliably. A simple- modular- central charging station- simplifies logistics and maintenance and lowers the cost of delivering renewable energy.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>This idea benefits people and communities in the developing world that do not have reliable access to electricity. Most of whom have cell phones. One quarter of the world’s population is still without electricity- yet according to a recent U.N. report- 6 billion out of 7 billion people on earth have mobile phones. Cell phones can greatly improve quality of life in a rural village by providing access to medical care and financial services- improving community safety- and enabling local business and commerce.Each station or network of stations will need to be operated by a local organization or individual.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>These stations provide an alternative to running diesel generators to charge batteries- and will reduce pressure to extend the grid from centralized fossil fuel plants. Just as the developing world leapfrogged land-based telephone lines to mobile technology- so too will it leap over the model of a centralized power grid for delivering electricity. As the developed world is looking to smart grids- micro-grids and energy storage to increase resiliency of the power grid and enable greater penetration of renewable energy- this same technology will be leveraged to more quickly and affordably electrify rural developing markets. Our stations will help pave the way for larger renewable power stations- that will likely be based on similar technology and concept- to provide a wider range of services to heavier loads- perhaps even electric vehicles- or to power loads in homes and community centers.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>WrightGrid is currently deploying our stations at schools and Universities across the US- as well as taking them to outdoor music festivals and other outdoor events to engage the public- develop our technology and better understand how people interface with the stations and what the expectations are. The response to our charging stations has been overwhelmingly positive thus far in the domestic market. People need and want continual use of their cell phone and are less concerned with how this is enabled. So the real value of energy is the service it provides to the end user.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We would love to hear insights from the folks at Ideo.org and others with experience working in the developing world about the best ways to deploy our station and build a local presence. I’m sure there are conditions ‘on the ground’ that we haven’t anticipated that will influence our design and business strategy. We are hoping to connect with folks who can work with us to design the human interface to be more intuitive and accessible for people who speak other languages or cannot read. We would love to hear ideas about the possibilities of connecting our stations with mobile applications and services. We need to identify strong partners and we also need to continue to work on developing models for funding the stations and generating revenues.There are many other considerations- design options- ideas- statistics and data we can share to help facilitate the conversation- but had to omit for the sake of brevity.

[UPDATED 7 Feb - video]</h2><p>Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount.

We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine.

Educated consumers will insist on businesses being more environmentally conscious, and this isn't a one-time thing.","The idea is pretty original in how it would be implemented. I like how it utilizes consumer input in combination with corporate action and investment. It seems organic in how it would work, for that reason, since companies respond to what motivates consumers to buy.","Specific steps are given to demonstrate how this idea would be implemented. Most of the steps seems feasible and economical, such as gauging consumer sentiment with surveys and promoting eco-friendly business initiatives with signage. As mentioned by the writer, the challenge would be convincing businesses that more costly investments -- in energy-efficient equipment, for instance -- is worth it. But, businesses respond when they see sales rise, so smart companies will realize the investment is going to pay off.","4","4","4"

They partnered with a local university in the Philippines- working one year to create a playground that could capture energy used on the equipment to power their local community.

That’s a good argument but financially at this moment in time it seems like some sort of child labor.","It seems like a fun idea but, just takes a lot of cooperation from everyone involved.

Using only gravity and water- the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to rotate and follow the sun throughout the day- boostingefficiency by 30%. It also produces clean water!The SunSaluter is built from common components and is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized panel rotators (called trackers)- and is much more durable without complex components.Solar power is a proven way to alleviate energy poverty- but it is simply still too expensive for many poor consumers. By increasing efficiency and lowering the overall cost per watt- the SunSaluter can help communities afford the transition to clean energy!</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>The SunSaluter is ideal for poor- rural individuals living without electricity. These individuals earn just dollars a day and often spend more than 20% of their income on kerosene gas and walk hours just to charge their cell phones. Solar energy is a great tool for eliminating these problems- but it is often still too expensive up-front for them. By boosting efficiency and lowering the cost per watt of solar energy- the SunSaluter brings solar energy within reach. For example- a 150 watt solar lantern charging station which powers 75 lanterns can be outfitted with a SunSaluter to be capable of charging 25 more lanterns. The individuals living in unelectrified communities also often lack access to clean water- so the SunSaluter provides a great additional benefit.For example- at the OneMama Clinic in Kirindi- Uganda- a SunSaluter installation has allowed women at the health clinic to not only eliminate the usage of kerosene- but to create a phone charging business to bolster their income.“The mamas are so excited that this is bringing light into an area where they spend the most time- which is in the Kitchen area- and also bringing energy for them to charge cell phones and purifying water- so we’re using it for tea and for cooking dinner.

Excellent solar technology is already available in many markets - but cost is still a primary barrier to widespread adoption. The SunSaluter is also unique in that it be installed with new solar systems or used to retrofit existing systems. With over 2 gigawatts of off-grid solar capacity currently installed worldwide- the solar infrastructure upon which to use the SunSaluter already exists- and is growing every day. The SunSaluter is simple to build and requires no special equipment nor training- meaning any community can adopt it rapidly. Lastly- if we can get local entrepreneurs to manufacture and distribute their own SunSaluters- costs will decrease dramatically and hopefully instill confidence in the community to adopt the technology.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>We have already deployed over 100 SunSaluters around the world - and every time we learn something new!

Oil would be collected for recycling on a regular basis, so it is self-sustaining. The challenge is getting the cooperation of businesses and the equipment needed for collection.","One detraction of this idea is that it is focused on Latin America; however, it can easily apply to a wider base and mentions both developing and developed societies as benefiting from used oil collection. The idea is not totally original, either, as used oil collection already occurs with fast food places, for instance. Making this collection system more widely available is desirable, though. And I like the idea of the education aspect, involving kids and schools.","Used oil collection already occurs, so its implementation has already proved possible. When the oil is recycled, I believe it pays for itself, making this economically practical. Adding an education component and involving kids and families makes the plan a bit more challenging.","5","3","4"

While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community.

While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea.</p><h4>What community does this idea benefit and who are the main players?</h4><p>Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.</p><h4>How does your idea specifically help your community rapidly transition to renewables?</h4><p>The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community. I would love to learn more about this kind of social dynamic.</p><h4>Please indicate which type of energy is most relevant to this post:</h4><p>Solar</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An Individual</p>","3","It could work but I can not be more sure.","I am not totally sure what the plan is.","It might be possible but am not sure what the idea is.","3","3","3"
