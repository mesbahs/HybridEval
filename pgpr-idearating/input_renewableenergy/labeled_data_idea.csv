302U8RURJZDWEP7Y1R2Q92RT4Q5VN2,302U8RURJZDWEP7Y1R2Q92RT4Q5VN2, The REISAP (Renewable Energy Information System Analysis Portal) Idea- has been developed from insights gained through my research phase of the How might communities lead the rapid transition to renewable energy?  project.A primilary depiction of this idea consists of 4 parts: -A web portal-A smartphone application-A specialized computer measuring/input device-An integrated community portal section and electrical micro-grid/distributed storage and renewable energy generation system This system is focused on users in low-density and rural areas where the local/regional utility is experience diminishing returns on their investment in providing energy to users (i.e. for every dollar the utility invests in energy product- they experience a negative return which increases with distance)The main players are the users- the portal operators and company- the microgrid operators- the suppliers and installers of energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and financing organizations. (Repeated from above)The idea addresses four issues or pain-points- identified in my previous post- “The Complexity (Paralysis) involved in the Transition to Renewable Energy”:-Decision analysis and comparison of current and future technologies-Being able to select feasible and practical energy consumption reduction methods- to reduce the size and cost of the installed renewable energy system-Being able to analyze and selecting between different system options (investing for water heating only first- then build on the system) paths based on least cost- investing in part now and the rest later- and available financing-Being able to apply what if scenarios- based on usage and environmental factors An early- lightweight experiment that I can you try out in my own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations- is to choose a:1. (option A)suburban home and apply a simplified version of the idea to a home in the suburban area 2. (option B) location in a rural area with basic energy needs The skills- input or guidance I would be keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to collaborate with and help you build out or refine this idea further are:A.

304QEQWKZPWY396UZ9EE3Y1804Y0OV,304QEQWKZPWY396UZ9EE3Y1804Y0OV, Kyrgyzstan has a considerable rural poor population and an ongoing energy crisis.Many of these rural communities have livestock- making them perfect candidates for biogas digesters as a source of cheap- renewable power- with the added benefit of manure as a by-product. However- there is as yet little understanding or trust in biogas as an energy source. This idea inspired communities to use biogas by providing a live and trusted demonstration of how it works. Harnessing children's natural 'pester power' and funding a pilot community will spread the power of poo to Kyrgyzstan's rural poor and enable them to lead their country's renewables transition. This benefits rural poor communities with livestock in Kyrgyzstan- one of DFID’s 28 priority countries. These communities live predominantly off their farming practices and have little or no access to energy. Kyrgyzstan has a high rate of literacy and we would expect the education of the target communities to be basic but with reading and writing competency. Rather than specify locations at this stage- it would be preferable to work with already established local NGOs to ensure the right pilot community is chosen- and help to build bridges to other communities.Specifically targeting the poorest families and women to become the community-employed plant maintenance operatives would help to address the additional needs of these groupings. These communities do not currently use renewable energy sources as uptake in Kyrgyzstan of biogas has been very limited- despite its perfect positioning for this fuel type due to its combination of livestock and an energy crisis. This is largely due to prohibitive costs and lack of understanding in communities which this idea seeks to overcome. By using the positive influencing of children and broadening this out to the whole grouping- the pilot community will recognise livestock excrement as a source of power and a solution to their energy needs. Running a workshop with children- and a second with children and parents- to test educational methods and the power of infant influencing- will help to understand the best methods of approaching this educational phase and ascertain what branding territories might be most applicable.

30UZJB2POHO8CRZ9DH0YWQZOMLD35O,30UZJB2POHO8CRZ9DH0YWQZOMLD35O, Unpredictable changes in global climate- economies plagued by chronic instability and energy insecurity with volatile fossil fuel costs are all manifestations of the pervasive uncertainty that defines our time. This instability is symptomatic of the undermining of a worldview of constant growth and inexhaustible resources that disregards biophysical limits and our interdependence with natural systems.Communities can confront this uncertainty through:1) design that increases the capacities of a system to assimilate change rather than for a predicted set of conditions- and 2) integration of human and natural systems towards a co-evolutionary symbiosis that is able to perform within the biological and physical constraints of our planet. This strategy/discussion would target planners- energy planners- urban designers on both the public and private sectors. We keep constructing the built environment - from electrical outlets to nation-wide oil pipelines and massive hydro dams - on old ideas of how energy infrastructure should function. These old ideas are biased towardstop/down- single-function- non-renewable rigid infrastructure which need to change if we want to have any hope in the large-scale adoption of renewable and effective energy that needs to happen. A collaborative analysis of existing infrastructure and its energy context of one city- from source to sink- to identify where there is opportunity for early intervention. Expertise from those on-the-ground who have faced some of the challenges of operating within old infrastructure models. Also scholars who are working more closely with thermodynamics- exergy and related concepts as well as ecologists who are more knowledgeable of how energy is transfered through trophic levels in natural systems.

31GN6YMHLP469RZ8ZXO8UYKDYYFSWL,31GN6YMHLP469RZ8ZXO8UYKDYYFSWL, In the more densely populated areas of a city there are generally large multi-residential buildings with occupants who already pay utilities. What if we had the option of paying a little more now as a group- so that everyone can benefit after the projects completion? Like crowdsourcing for renewables at the local and individual level. The residents who help fund a project will benefit along with the building owners. It's community specific- not nessesarily for every area or low density populations. Get enough people to chip in and those individuals will be rewarded and possibly those who didn't. It also takes some of the cost away from one individual and spreads it across many people to make it more affordable. Community meetings to see who would be interested and how it benefits them. Urban planners definitely- along with architects and community outreach programs. A combination of various types of renewable energy An Individual,0,2,1,4,3,0

32PT7WK7DMR3G4E2SNIHU2NGZ2B3DW,32PT7WK7DMR3G4E2SNIHU2NGZ2B3DW, The idea is to give rewards to individuals and organisations in the form of:1.Annual Awards for those who have helped to reduce- generate and store renewable energy the most within that year.2.Project Funding for the few top winners who would like to develop their project further.3.Incentives based on the amount of energy they have saved- generated or stored for others. The idea can benefit any community- around the world. The focus is to connect individuals and small organisation to help each other in collaborating to create sustainable environments beyond their owns.GIVING BACK program includes everybody with different motivations in creating sustainable environments. The environment savvy- the people and communities and small organisations who need to create their legacy- the entrepreneurs- designers and any individuals who would like to get simple payments from their efforts. We can also involve big corporations in: 1.CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) departments to sponsor this initiative 2.Companies who produce green technology to sponsor a community to start this program. GIVING BACK program provides opportunities for everybody to start their own renewable energy initiatives and extend their individual efforts to others and rewarded for it. The implementation could be started within a small community of approximately 50 participating households from different backgrounds and few community buildings such as schools- clinics and markets. To build this idea further- I would love the OpenIdeo community to help giving ideas and to develop developing the tools (smart-energy meter and the applications tied to it) and ideas or any suggestions on how to transfer stored energy in a simplest way possible.

32PT7WK7DMR3G4E2SNIHU2NGZ2BD36,32PT7WK7DMR3G4E2SNIHU2NGZ2BD36, What would you do- if you could get all the energy that you could need in your life for just- one dollar? Besides stopping fossil and nuclear energy costs and pollution.There are such amazing and great projects- ideas and investigations about Renewable Infinite Energy production- besides the great ideas of all the people in here- that need to be known and supported to improve our world- so… “Lets make a viral commitment to support them”The main renewable energy generation methods to focus on-in my opinion must be the Electricity production from MAGNETISMandELECTROLYSIS PROCESSES to produce Hydrogen- Oxygen- and Electricity from water and air. Because this energy sources don’t depend on climatic circumstances- to produce energy. Every community and every one shall benefit form renewable infinite energy- we all are the main players by doing a commitment to donate for support and by learning and teaching othersabout this kind of energy. Via the viral commitment to spread knowledge and teach 10 different persons every week until every one on earth knows that everyone can produce and how to produce his own energy. I can go out and start to speak to people about producing your own Renewable Infinite Energy and watch their reaction to the information- I’ll ask if they agree to the dollar donation as well. Every body wants to save money- don’t we? I have talk to a couple of persons and their reaction was positive. One of them even said- I wish you can make it come true. I wish you could help me and the world to develop and administrate the donation system and project sponsoring methodology. A type of energy not listed An Individual,0,1,1,1,1,0

3538U0YQ1F60EOSYJTD7I2Q1BFR3F7,3538U0YQ1F60EOSYJTD7I2Q1BFR3F7, It's Airbnb meets PG&E--apply P2P platforms to DERs- allowing individuals to directly sell excess electricity production from renewable energy.Electricity producers will be financially empowered- consumers will have cheaper and more renewable options- and the energy market will become more efficient.The expected outcome is that communities would rapidly transition to renewables as people increasingly profit from the energy sharing economy! This idea will greatly benefit any community that uses energy from a centralized electrical grid.In developing countries- this idea has the potential to not only drive down energy prices but also financially empower individuals and communities. By increasing access to cheaper sources of electricity- namely DERs- then communities will naturally pursue renewable energy sources.As the P2P energy sharing economy flourishes- potential producers will increasingly pursue a variety of cost-efficient methods of producing renewable energy in order to play in this market. Develop the P2P platform and link one neighborhood with particulary low access to renewables with another neighborhood with a particularly high production of renewables.Analyze electrical usage and bills before and after the introduction of the P2P platform. I'm interested in getting guidance from managers and electrical engineers from utility companies- electrical engineers with experience with grids- electricians with experience in renewable energy- and app developers.

35U0MRQMUJJEWA7A2623ORRYU0AVOH,35U0MRQMUJJEWA7A2623ORRYU0AVOH, Having access to electricity shouldn't be the only objective but it should be well utilized to gain the most out of it and create a sea of possibilities.Community owned micro-hydro plants are widespread in parts of Nepal.However- they are often tremendously under-utilized- and the electricity generated is used only for modest lighting of homes and charging mobile phones.This is not the best use of scarce capital resources. Microgrids are usually located at regions where the national grid cannot connect under cost effective conditions. Without access to electricity- day to day activities are difficult. Such communities are the victims of poor quality living trying to adapt with the unavailability of critical resources due to its geographical location or being isolated from urban areas.Such was the condition at Barpak- Gorkha until they had access to electricity due to which anchor loads could also depend on along with the use in households and productive end uses. However- it was not just the access to electricity but the technique for its efficient consumption that accelerated their rate of development drastically. There are communities in Nepal which lack the availability of electric energy and communities where micro grids are already established and yet they rely on the use of coal and other natural resources. Our scheme encourages efficient consumption- rapid development and replaces the need of consuming natural resources.The existing micro grids or national grids that supply energy to communities don’t have such schemes with demand side management i.e structuring the load by charging different tariff rates for various time of consumption. So why not establish a structure of consumption if it makes a system more reliable and productive. A proof of this scheme already exists in a community called Barpak located in Gorkha district in Nepal. It provides an output of 130 kW to the community consisting of approximately thousand households. The attractive part is that this scheme provides an uninterruptible supply of electricity at a cheaper rate than what is provided by the government. However- the main point is that the community experienced rapid development after availability of facilities like bakery- mills- cable television- metal workshops and internet.Our vision is to replicate this proof in other communities through collaborations and implementation. Any form of input is welcome. It may be ideas that provide incentives for communities to implement this scheme or replacing an asset that they need daily by another that consumes renewable energy instead due to which they might prefer the consumption of renewable energy and even any commentsregarding the post.

36818Z1KV3P5IXBQ8DRF41FAEZE3AU,36818Z1KV3P5IXBQ8DRF41FAEZE3AU, Younger people often convince their parents to go green because of their strong concern about climate change.What if we incentivized this by offering scholarships or forgiving student loans?e.g. If a family with a kid installs solar on their roof- the kid gets $2000 scholarship fund.If the family buys a an electric vehicle or a plug in hybrid- the young person gets another $2000.This could add up quickly as kids realize there's money to be had in getting their parents to do the right thing.Parents could also decide to go green because they love their kids and the incentives help them out.It could lead to a lot of change fast.Let's harness the younger generation's environmental energy to change their parent's actions now! This could benefit families with kids. Younger folks get help with paying for college.Older folks get renewable energy and a lower carbon footprint.Everybody benefits if more families go green. It helps create a tipping point to engage kids in working on greening the world and fighting climate change while receiving an incentive that will directly help them.Younger people want climate action anyway.If you pay them to work on it- they'll work that much harder.Also parents (usually) trust and love their kids.For the parents- kids are a trusted messenger- so the kid has a pretty good chance of convincing their parents to make the change- especially if the kid explains that the change will help them lead a better quality of life when they are their parents age.This whole idea could work for grandchildren and grandparents too. Do a test where a foundation or private donor puts the word out there in a certain community that it will pay millennials whose parents go green- and see if the rate of going green goes up or not. I'd like to connect with a funder who is willing to fund a study to see if the idea works.We could start with LED lightbulbs in a certain city or neighborhood.If kids convince their parents to switch to LED's- the kid get's a scholarship- or money for books etc. I'm a media maker who is already connected with a think tank of environmentalists based in SF.

36FQTHX3Z33A17GIERRBZCZGWHZ3BP,36FQTHX3Z33A17GIERRBZCZGWHZ3BP, WrightGrid is developing solar powered charging stations that can help rural communities in the developing world gain access to electricity and lead the transition to renewable energy. In today’s world of mobile technology and rechargeable batteries- people don’t necessarily need electricity delivered to their home - they need a battery charged. By providing lockers at a station- members of the community can drop off their device (or battery) for charging- and feel confident that their property will be secure and charged reliably. A simple- modular- central charging station- simplifies logistics and maintenance and lowers the cost of delivering renewable energy. This idea benefits people and communities in the developing world that do not have reliable access to electricity. Most of whom have cell phones. One quarter of the world’s population is still without electricity- yet according to a recent U.N. report- 6 billion out of 7 billion people on earth have mobile phones. Cell phones can greatly improve quality of life in a rural village by providing access to medical care and financial services- improving community safety- and enabling local business and commerce.Each station or network of stations will need to be operated by a local organization or individual. These stations provide an alternative to running diesel generators to charge batteries- and will reduce pressure to extend the grid from centralized fossil fuel plants. Just as the developing world leapfrogged land-based telephone lines to mobile technology- so too will it leap over the model of a centralized power grid for delivering electricity. As the developed world is looking to smart grids- micro-grids and energy storage to increase resiliency of the power grid and enable greater penetration of renewable energy- this same technology will be leveraged to more quickly and affordably electrify rural developing markets. Our stations will help pave the way for larger renewable power stations- that will likely be based on similar technology and concept- to provide a wider range of services to heavier loads- perhaps even electric vehicles- or to power loads in homes and community centers. WrightGrid is currently deploying our stations at schools and Universities across the US- as well as taking them to outdoor music festivals and other outdoor events to engage the public- develop our technology and better understand how people interface with the stations and what the expectations are. The response to our charging stations has been overwhelmingly positive thus far in the domestic market. People need and want continual use of their cell phone and are less concerned with how this is enabled. So the real value of energy is the service it provides to the end user. We would love to hear insights from the folks at Ideo.org and others with experience working in the developing world about the best ways to deploy our station and build a local presence. I’m sure there are conditions ‘on the ground’ that we haven’t anticipated that will influence our design and business strategy. We are hoping to connect with folks who can work with us to design the human interface to be more intuitive and accessible for people who speak other languages or cannot read. We would love to hear ideas about the possibilities of connecting our stations with mobile applications and services. We need to identify strong partners and we also need to continue to work on developing models for funding the stations and generating revenues.There are many other considerations- design options- ideas- statistics and data we can share to help facilitate the conversation- but had to omit for the sake of brevity. And while we could spend a lot of time talking about our ideas so far- we really want to hear YOUR ideas!,0,3,3,4,3,0
36JW4WBR06WF8WZXYE29MWRBUK9FHQ,36JW4WBR06WF8WZXYE29MWRBUK9FHQ, Kids have energy. There's no doubt about that. Their favorite part of school is recess and they can't wait to get outside. What if we could use all of this energy to power places in our community- including our schools?Tiger Energy Biscuits- a Kraft company-used this same idea to build a playground. They partnered with a local university in the Philippines- working one year to create a playground that could capture energy used on the equipment to power their local community. This can be even more advanced- using other technology such as energy capturing tiles currently used at stadiums. This is a learning opportunity for kids and become cost effective for communities- and promote a school or business in the process. The community: The cool thing about this is that it can be placed into any community.A community could plant a park- transform a park- add it to their schools- implement this into malls- theme-parks- anything! Once a community invests the time into making one- the parts and playground can be easily re-created for another location or purpose. If a city just wanted one swing set- they could just start out with that. With the money they save- they could grow their playground and their investment into even more opportunities for reusable energy.The people: Being a college student- I'm always looking for opportunities for projects like this to use my talents and make an impact- and I know I'm not the only one. Schools will want to be a part of this if it gives exposure to their university- and the opportunity for students to have a real-life experience. The kids: When I was a kid- we used to convince my teacher to give us extra recess. I know in second grade I would have so many questions of how the playground worked and why we were doing it. This could even be a fun way for schools and students to compete. They could see which class created the most energy- competing against their friends or even schools competing against schools.The city: This could create so much publicity for the city and others involved- going green is always a trend- and this is a cool way to promote it. This idea isn't just about changing light-bulbs. This is about creating sustainable playgrounds that can power a city for years and years.Renewable energy- our focus is trying to change and develop things that already exist such as the oil industry- when we should be looking to completely new ideas (like Open IDEO is doing). If people want to have an impact on their planet- instead of waiting on someone else to change their energy- a community can start this on their own. They don't need to wait for a big company or organization- they can start making environmental change on their own! 1. Classes can start the discussion of energy- and start to brainstorm their own ideas and concepts for creating this renewable playground. This is the most cost effective and easiest way to see the potential of this project.2. Communities can host an even- putting things such as sustainable dance floors can be put in place to see how much energy a group of people can actually create! Their interest might start the discussion of putting this in place.http://www.sustainabledanceclub.com/products/sustainable_dance_floor/3. The company Playground Energy uses the energy from children- to create a better playground experience by adding light and sound with their energy used. Even just putting one of these items in place- you can begin to see value in the energy of kids.http://www.playgroundenergy.com/ This idea is good- but it can be something even greater.Post your input on how we can evolve this into something amazing!How can this playground improve your community? Are there any other pieces of technology out there that support this idea? How can we make this already existing idea better? How can this be tied into idea of a power-producing gym?

We believe renewable energy should be fully integrated into to our living and working spaces as a standard option. This combined with a high efficiency building envelopes and natural water treatment systems will allow people to build new towns and cities nearly anywhere in the worldin a way that is truly sustainable. Our designs are intended to be locally manufactured and assembled in order to create jobs for these communities.For the people- by the people! Our product is intended for a number of communities- these are as follows:The 863 million people across the world are living in slum conditions. (As of 2015). The 42 million people left homeless because of natural disasters. (2010 Figure). The 27 percent of Americans that spend more than half their income on rent. (As of 2010) The 3 billion people- or about 40 per cent of the world’s population- that will need proper housing and access to basic infrastructure by 2030- according to UN HabitatOur population is expanding at an exponential rate and the only way to achieve an acceptable standard of living for the people of this planet is through innovation. We implore you to help us with this mission. If renewable energy comes standard on any living or working space we build- than the need to “transition” becomes unnecessary. In addition- if these spaces are so elegant and desirable that all the surrounding communities decide they simply must have them- than you start a renewable energy movement by demand. This is a very important factor. The majority of people didn't crave electric automobiles until Tesla started making them desirable. We must combine the form of beautifully designed housing with the function on renewable energy in order to create a scaleable solution that will go viral. Avava systems has approached the owners of a few vacant lots around the San Francisco Bay area and has received permission to do a pilot projects at these locations. This would allow us to test an initial production run of our units as well as get feedback from local users. We are also in conversation with a architecture firm that is working on sustainable work force housing for a number of projects throughout North America. The folks at AVAVA Systems love meeting anyone who is passionate about affordable- sustainable housing. With that said- we are especially interested meeting people are working on real development projects and are open to innovative methods. We are also currently in fund raising mode- so if you or someone you know is interested in investing in “the most compelling way to build our communities” we would love to talk to them. Finally- we are always interested in talking to mechanical engineers and industrial designers.(UPDATE) One of the best things about contributing to this challenge has been the talented people that have come forward to offer their time and expertise to help us be more successful. 1. Thank you so much to Matthew Chow from the IDEO team for the help he gave us regarding our business strategy. Matthew started with a great template to evaluate our product applications. He then helped us figure out a clear and concise business plan around that application including potential partnerships- value proposition and growth strategy. Matthew's energy was inspiring and he asked some really good questions. We really appreciate the time and effort he devoted to our company.2. We have been contacted by mechanical engineer who shares our vision for creating affordable- sustainable and sexy housing solutions. We look forward to collaborating with her. We have also been contacted by a designer who is focusing on better utilizingpublic and vacant spaces- and we hope to provide him with some innovative solutions. A big thank you to OpenIDEO for getting our idea in front of people in a way that inspires them. We look forward to strengthening these relationships and building more as we move forward.

37MQ8Z1JQE8HTXDAKJRQODSPBCGY2N,37MQ8Z1JQE8HTXDAKJRQODSPBCGY2N, In most secondary schools curriculums- pupils receive some sort of cooking and manual skills lessons. Why not let them make a solar panel to take home? It would be used (because parents would be proud of the achievement) and it would leave a memorable memory to the kid- who will become more knowledgeable about solar and renewable energy. We are looking at local communities here. We are touching kids ages 8-14- who are late primary or early secondary school.The childrens parents will be engaged via their kids.For it to work- we need to engage headmasters/mistresses in the program.What's in it for them? Initially- the aura of being innovative and a pilot school. It might be easier to start with private schools that might be more able to modify and adjust what they teach.Eventually though- the idea is to get public school to adopt the program too. The power of making something is incredible- and children can influence their parents. If kids understand what is involved in solar energy (because they are making panels)- how much energy is required to charge a mobile phone (in relation to the effort they made) and what you can use the energy generated for- I believe they will become responsible adults.Eventually- they'll be able to pick-up renewable energy when they can make their own choices- in 5 to 10 years from now- if not before. For me- the first early and cheap experiment is to contact a school- ask if there are interested and make a pilot.I've contacted a few people and some are interested already (this is a good sign- I think) I guess- then we'llneed to test: - the scalability of the venture.We could probably systematically contact other establishment with a description of the project- and capture the number of signups (we can do this very lo-key with flyers- or door to door communication. - does it havethe expected effect in the community (i.e. are pupils and people more aware of what the could be using solar energy for)On this- I'm thinking we could perhaps we could survey child and parents before and after the workshop?Do other members of the community have other ideas? I've got a lot of good ideas from the community already- thank you!If more people are interested in this idea- the ideo community could help with: - Finding a name for the program- and define more stuff the schools could do with the energy generated. - Testing the appetite for the idea by contacting their local schools. - Helping with the physics of the idea. I'm not sure at the moments how big the panel needs to be for what we need- although I'm thinking we Demand Energy Equality can help. - Understanding Health and Safety regulation that could prevent the project to see the light.- I think if it works- we'll have some PR to do too- so we'll need a website to refer too. Help there could be very useful. Solar An Individual,0,3,3,2,3,0
37NXA7GVSTI6QP4DPEMBWAN4ZV5VL0,37NXA7GVSTI6QP4DPEMBWAN4ZV5VL0, Transform the physical activity into electricity!Our idea is to use the force invested by the human body in moving heavy weights- walking- swinging and other activities- into energy.With the combination of discounts and gamification incentives- people from all ages would start to interact with the concept of being energy.MISSION & VISIONTo break the gap that exists between people and energy generation. Our vision is to shape the future into a community were through collaboration green and renewable energy can be produced- and that is perceive as a fun and healthy activity- either if you do it on a park- playground- gym or by installing a solar panel- contributing with energy generation would be the new Status Quo. People from 10 to 70 years old that are able to do physical activities. Kids would interact with the POWERkids playgrounds- and would be motivated by the discounts and promotions they can get of app store of apple. This would help early generations in their transition to renewable energies by allowing them interact with games and the term of producing energy. Older users would share the need of becoming or being helthy- but would have the motivation of accesing to discounts and prices for ranking up. Another possitive impact would be changing the mind set of“investing energy in working out” to “giving energy while working out”.Another issue tackled by this idea is that the actual renewable sources such as sun and wind- are limited to the space condition- if there is not sun- no energy and the same with wind and water. This energy source comes from a resource that we have everywhere: people. A POWERLIFT could be open in an isolated village that doesn’t have wind- sun or water as an energy resource to power it up. OpenCALI team thinks that the main reason for a slow transition from our current reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energies is that the actual options are not accessible and therefore there isn’t an interaction between the people and this technology.POWERLIFT erases this gap- allowing people to interact with a renewable energy technology- accelerating this transition and changing the actual status quo of “being fit” to “being energy”. Until this point we haven’t done any test- we have done some research and know that the technology is being applied (links bellow) in other fields. At the moment we are working to calculate if it is possible to transform the gym into the electricity source of a neighborhood- how many people would be needed? How high would be the POWERLIFT daily goal? Etc.Jumping to prototyping with real people- we are thinking of testing the user experience in a local gym. Doing a wizard of oz prototype for the bracelet- where supposedly the harder you train the more energy you give to the gym- and therefor if your train hard enough- the gym is free. We would try to test this at the end of the upcoming week with a smartwatch- where a video would be played as if a battery was being charged over time.Another needed prototype- is the functional one. One of the OpenCALI member is an electronic engineer with experience on renewable energy- with him we would prototype a bench press that produces energy. (this is a more complex prototype- so it would take longer)Regarding the other exercises such as spinning- group classes and running in the treadmill there is actual studies and technologies to get energy from it- so there is not an immediate need to test it.

I will reach out to the principals to see if they'd like to engage on OpenIDEO if there's interest. The main players are the city politicians and staff; community organizers; block-by-block resident groups; individuals and families The tools for real community engagement and recruitment exist. This research has been demonstrated as viable and is ready to scale. Once brought to scale- this methodology will engage individuals at the block level to implement carbon reduction strategies- including renewable energy. This is a perfect organizing tool to be added to system designs for community-scale renewable energy. Of then the technological solutions leave out the community-building solutions- which are the only viable pathway for fast adoption. Some lightweight experiments have been completed.

37Y5RYYI0PHLYR4Y92KUWHYK70LSXE,37Y5RYYI0PHLYR4Y92KUWHYK70LSXE, This idea is a mechanical system that collects rain water at a height and uses this to turn a dynamo and recharge large batteries as it comes down to ground level. Here it is emptied into storage tanks or wells for later use.The system provides free renewable energy and clean water to remote areas with high rainfall anywhere in the world.The key points are that: -it can be reasonably cheap to make and easy for local communities to construct themselves. - Useful in areas that are often cloudy and solar is not particularly effective - Each tower can generate enough electricity topower lighting at a recharge station and recharge radio equipment or mobile phones for locals. The biggest places that will benefit are those in high rainfall/monsoon regions where a lot of rain can fall for many days. During the rainy season heavy cloud cover can mean very little sunlight for effective solar panel use. Areas that have no electricity supply at all will benefit the most. We need to be able to use mathematical/physics models to see how much rain water needs to be collected to generate certain amounts of electricity. What size of trough is needed- how may towers are needed to have a constant supply of electricity while it rains? A type of energy not listed An Individual,0,4,5,4,5,0

It is a city that will be completely free from any form of fossil fuel for its power usage thereby making it a renewable energy powered city. The appealing nature of the project will create a huge demand for more of this city projects in more locations inAfrica and even the world at large. Smart City Africa Project is beneficial to African residents and visitors from all works of life- all ages- and the location choice will focus on rural areas which are abundant in unused land areas thereby depopulating the popular cities and building new and smart cities from the revenues and products of the Pioneer smart city.Because of the comprehensive nature of the city- It will impact lives in so many waysthereby creating a smart living culture among residents of the smart city.I see a sustainable future and a city like this would be a big step to creating that sustainable future-so far I have thought of several ways to create this future- well I came up with an Idea . since it takes a huge fund to make this project a reality- I thought of drawing up a 3D design of this plan and marketing it like an off plan project which will come with a price as well as incentives. Although my target might not be the low class population but I thought of the idea of selling citizenship's to this city with a starting price of $5000 individuals to $20000 for families and at this price citizens can benefit from free health care- a housing unit and security as well as business opportunities in the city. this can be achieved because Africans yearn to live in a better environment and for that price the middle class can really benefit from this- and since the first phase of this city is to set up energy efficient production lines which would be used in construction of the city- the low class can also benefit by having massive job creations. As a Smart City Project- powered by renewable energy- also a production hub for manufacturing of energy efficient products- which will be used to build more smart cities across Africa- the transition will be an unconscious and automatic one. As the demand for more smart cities will increase- especially due to the affordability of energy efficient living. I would like to add some further Statistics- the most populated city in Africa Lagos is approximately 1000km2 with a population of about 20 million people and the reason for the huge population because of the amount of production going on in the city. so if a new and smart city with 3 times the land mass and over 500 energy efficient production lines and over 1000 services and small companies and businesses- there will be a huge significance in the major cities depopulation as citizens will begin to seek employment in the new city and the Smart City Africa project is looking to be home to 5 million citizens. A plan is all it takes. if a plan of this city is designed and awareness is being created for the Smart City Africa Project- it will attract governments- investors- banks- communities- individuals and many more fund sources to partake in the project. choosing a location for a pioneer smart city in Africa- Nigeria by population is the largest populated country in Africa with major cities like Lagos- Abuja and Port Harcourt. But the smart city best location would be the less populated locations that are close to the major cities such as Imo state- Akwa Ibom state- Cross river state etc.. The skills required for the Smart City Africa Project idea are as many as one can imagine Architects/ designers-Engineers-Technology experts-Accountants-urban city planners-renewable energy experts- and many more experts.

3909MD9T2ZT3OM8V8DU31TUY24HFEA,3909MD9T2ZT3OM8V8DU31TUY24HFEA, The Union of Concerned Scientists says that biodiesel made from waste materials or used cooking oil can cut global warming pollution by 80 to 90 percent relative to conventional diesel fuel. This idea builds on the simple idea of producing biodiesel with used cooking oil at the local level- in developing economies by removing a common barrier to setting up small biodiesel plants: training and technology acquisition needed to empower local production. Using a simple training (academy) model- this scheme will produce wide benefits to local entrepreneurs- ecosystems- and to participating businesses. There are many different community members that benefit from this idea: - Local food producers: From restaurant owners- to operators of small food stands- anyone with used cooking oil on their hands can now see additional income on a regular business by becoming part of the feedstock bank for the local plant. - Local entrepreneurs: Setting up a biodiesel factory can provide long-term- sustainable income in any area with a thriving commercial sector (hotels- restaurants- etc.) This business can also provide green jobs to several employees. - Vehicle owners: Biodiesel is an affordable- clean alternative to conventional diesel. It helps vehicles run smoother and leads to engines lasting much longer. Further- owners won't be subject to the price volatility of fossil fuels. - Community members: Everyone in the community will enjoy the longterm health benefits that come with increasing renewable fuels in the area- less asthma- less polluted waters- less lung disease. And- in the long term- a thriving ecosystem and environment. In many developing nations- citizens rely on generators as a vital power source- using biodiesel instead of traditional diesel can produce powerful environmental benefits. Once a plant is set up with equipment and some initial feedstock (used cooking oil)- the timeline to produce an initial batch of biodiesel is very short (a few days).From here- the work is to secure and widen a customer base by spreading the word and educating the community on the benefits of switching to biodiesel. This idea is simple- biodiesel plants will become valuable environmental education centers for the community- which is just as important as their production capacity. By providing an alternate- clean fuel source- these plants can encourage a swift transition to renewable fuels from polluting ones for anyone that owns a vehicle or generator. At this point- I need to better understand the costs associated with setting up a small biodiesel plant- including the price of necessary machinery- and the steps needed to ship it to various regions around the world. To do this- I can start reaching out to some equipment producers to obtain price quotes and information on shipping. [Update: added interview!]Additionally- I need to better understand what type of organizational model would work best here (nonprofit/social enterprise). - What are some ideas for how I can make this business model lean? The goal is to make this service as affordable as possible for local entrepreneurs interested in setting up and owning plants. - Are there business models out there that I should look to for inspiration- including outside of the renewable energy sector?- Does anyone have information biodiesel equipment pricing- or can you recommend good companies that I should look into?

39O0SQZVJNJFIXYUC0GRC8G0J5O7RB,39O0SQZVJNJFIXYUC0GRC8G0J5O7RB, Participate in PRIME’s proof-of-concept investment- Quidnet- by making a $100K-$400K: 1) grant to PRIME or 2) program-related investment (convertible note) directly to Quidnet (or to PRIME as nonprofit intermediary).Quidnet is a for-profit company deploying low-cost grid-scale energy storage. The company’s technology will provide energy developers and utilities with a solution for storing up to giga-watt hours of electricity at a cost point unachievable in the current marketplace. An early injection of philanthropic capital will allow Quidnet to complete its pilot project in West Texas and solicit follow-on investment from the private markets. There are two distinct ways in which an early investment in Quidnet would benefit our communities in the US and abroad: 1) directly through the charitable impacts of Quidnet's core business and 2) indirectly as a proof-of-concept for PRIME. Due to the intermittency issues associated with solar and wind electricity generation- energy storage is vital to deployment of renewables in any community.Unfortunately- the capital cost of the batteries included in a residential off-grid solar plus batteries system currently cost about $500 per kWh. However- to achieve cost parity with the grid- the capital cost of batteries would need to decline to about $20 per kWh.Absent a major technological breakthrough- battery costs are likely to remain above $20 per kWh for several decades. In 2012- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that battery costs would fall as low as $135 per kWh by 2035 in the best case scenario.Quidnet's unconventional solution could help us reach these goals much sooner and help communities all over the world transition to renewables without ongoing government or philanthropic subsidies. Quidnet is testing its concept by using a spent oil well in West Texas as a pilot project. It is taking assets that sit idle -- spent oil and gas wells -- and turning them into a force for good.

39O6Z4JLX291QJL23XPZ74IR64FXVO,39O6Z4JLX291QJL23XPZ74IR64FXVO, Our idea is a solar pay-as-you-go “business in a box” kit for Tanzania. It is an income-producing asset for an entrepreneur (just like a chicken or goat) but it is also an affordable way to buy light (and mobile phone charging) for an end-consumer. The kit consists of 2 “hockey puck” rechargeable lights/phone chargers and 1 solar panel as well as instructional information and marketing materials. We call it the “hockey puck” because it looks like a hockey puck (we’re Canadian) and contains a rechargeable battery- LED- USB phone charger. We will sell this kit to entrepreneurs who then earn income from selling recharges and an end-user now has access to clean- affordable light and energy. It's a win win. Social: Lack of light at night restricts children’s study hours. Toxic fumes cause death. KARIBU offers children the opportunity to study at night- the family to charge their mobile phone- and eliminates toxic kerosene fumes.Environmental: The use of kerosene emits millions of tons of CO2 / year and every KARIBU solar lamp sold reduces CO2 emissions by an estimated 100kg / year.Economic: Families waste 90+ USD every year on fuel and lack of light restricts local entrepreneurs. KARIBU saves money and increases working hours for small businesses.With KARIBU- families can afford solar lighting/mobile phone charging with the benefits above. For small shops- they now have a profitable business and no longer spend money on kerosene – sunshine is free. Furthermore- money stays in the community (that formerly went to buy kerosene) and it spurs local economic development. Solar in Africa comes with a significant up ­front cost- which is not affordable for rural populations (and it's hard to get it to them). Our approach aligns the cash flow for solar lighting and mobile phone charging with that of kerosene–making it affordable. We leverage the existing sales channel for end­-users like Alice (the small shop network) and sell them a “businesses in a box” which allows them to become profitable in a few months.In contrast to the traditional manufacturer → retailer → customer model- KARIBU provides a continuous income stream (and more jobs) for entrepreneurs vs. a one-­off sale. This approach is very conducive to rural communities that are far from towns or the electric grid and that have no mobile network reception (and it doesn't have to be constructed/nailed to a roof). Given the relatively low up ­front cost for small shops- and short payback period- the model is very scalable. We are in the early stages of launching these new kits. We ran a small pilot project in Moshi- Kilimanjaro with great success. Here are some videos with one of the entrepreneurs- Good Hope:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L_Ln96e0iY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWWA1CriF0k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIo-OaNlyAU We are looking for help in making the product very high quality and also cost effective.

3A520CCNWNC8SVRNXX8BNSJ75O4AES,3A520CCNWNC8SVRNXX8BNSJ75O4AES, Imagine if we in the Bay Area could generate more renewable energy than we use- sequester more carbon than we emit- and use only the water we have locally- all by the year 2050? Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto. Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond. In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals. Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation. As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community. We also would love to have volunteers as part of our planning or outreach teams. We welcome donations to help underwrite the cost of solutions that we are working to deploy.

3AJA9FLWSCAF4RAH4WKUM8SQUXOFIJ,3AJA9FLWSCAF4RAH4WKUM8SQUXOFIJ, Used Kitchen Oil Collection Program is really for anyone. Everybody cooks- everybody fries. And so everybody has leftover used cooking oil and in many cases does not know what to do with it. Only ahandful of countries have a working used kitchen oil collection program and the awareness is still very low. In third world countries and developing countries- often such oil isn't disposed properly because there are simply no means of doing so. By implementing a collection system in such countries- we not only protect the environment a little more- we also help to produce biofuels that can be reused over and over again as it is done in the UK for example. This program would target local communities of Latin American countries where there is no working used oil collection system. Even if there is two restaurants that somehow recycle their used oil or dispose it relatively safely- the remaining fifty will pour the oil down the drain- which will clog the pipes of the entire building- street- neighborhood- city... Except for the local communities- this will be an initiative for those who are interested in using biofuels in order to either protect the environment- be more cost effective- or both.Strongly suggested would be to target children from elementary school- through high school to university by directly involving them in the program. Why? Simply because the future starts with the children. Educating them about biofuels will ensure their eco-responsibility standards to be higher. And how would this be done? The youngest ones could simply collect used cooking oil from their mom's kitchen and bring it to school that will then hand it over to the collection site. In the case of older children/teenagers- they could participate in the site collection directly as an extra curriculum activity. Used cooking oil is a very fast way to obtain biofuels. It is everywhere and there is an abundance of it. The first step in Bogota would be to simply do an on-site research. Talking to individual restaurant and stall owners and finding out how do they handle used oil and if they would be willing to participate in such a program. This project will definitely need experts on biofuel production- environment safety experts- engineers- educators for the program and anyone who would be excited about the idea.

3BS6ERDL93J2DN1KBPGF15Z09TDD6C,3BS6ERDL93J2DN1KBPGF15Z09TDD6C, Educate and motivate consumers to purchase pro-renewable products. Then use that consumer demand to encourage companies to measure their success with not only profits- but their positive impact on the environment and society too (The Triple Bottom Line).That one change in how a business officially measures success will provide the motivation for employees to make thousands of other decisions to support adoption of renewable energies. If customers and society at large expect that businesses will measure and publicize their impact on energy consumption- then businesses will start to make decisions to improve these numbers.With consumer education efforts such as The Story of Stuff Project (http://storyofstuff.org/)- businesses that don't participate will lose consumers who care. As a result- smart energy consumption decisions could become a competitive advantage. The business sector makes up a huge portion of energy consumption- policy lobbying- and pioneering/financing new ideas. This new measurement approach would steer those resources to find better solutions both in local communities and on the larger global stage with corporations. 1. Start by approaching small to medium sized- non-chain retail businesses in small towns. These owners know their customers and their customers know them. 2. Survey customers about sentiments of the business- their value to their community and their likeliness to be more loyal if the business made better energy decisions.3. Present easy to implement- low-cost changes they can make to improve their local community through better energy consumption. 4. Promote those changes to customers with foam core signs in retail stores.5.Measure customer sentiments- level of loyalty- and likeliness to spend more money with the business in the future. 6. Use this as a case study with larger businesses. The improved customer satisfaction- loyalty- and likeliness to buy more in the future can serve as justification for budgets for new initiatives and the marketing budgets to tell customers about them. CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON FEEDBACK:The laundromat is a great type of business to target considering their high energy usage. However- one challenge might be getting businesses make large capital expenditures before users have shown that they would become more loyal. Perhaps in-store surveys- anecdotal conversations- and pledge commitments could help justify the new expenses. Another approach could be to start with low cost additions. Washing machines last a long time and only need to be upgraded every 15 years (guessing). Maybe light bulbs- floor fans- ceiling fans- air conditioners- shifting business hours to daylight hours to cut down on lights- and insulation upgrades could be alternatives. What types of practical changes would bring the biggest impact with the least amount of effort? Which changes are difficult- but also provide the biggest gains?

3D1UCPY6GGLRZ9IBBF718A9FOBE38Q,3D1UCPY6GGLRZ9IBBF718A9FOBE38Q, Imagine you wanted to make the shift to an alternative energy source- how would you do it? Consumers- financiers- and technical providers will be able to directly connect through our online social marketplace: closing the access gap to renewable energy. Whether the consumer is an individual- a school- or neighborhood- they can find the resources and options they need: banks to finance a program- a government grant for their project- or the technical experts to make it happen.Local options will be showcased- allowing each community to build and tailor their options organically.Consumers- financiers- and technical providers can post a call for proposals for a specific project or just start a conversation with potential partners. This benefits the current and future players in the renewable energy marketplace. The way that Craigslist or eBay facilitated connections to happen by providing an online platform- we are adding an additional layer of communication to make getting renewable energy easier.Interested teachers can see the options available to their school- whether with energy providers or potential financiers. Homeowners that don't have the funds to install renewable energy can find a grant focused on this switch in their area and the company to make the switch. Addressing all needs in one marketplace - the demand- the supply- and the money - we give people the space to proactively seek solutions tailored to their needs. Currently the available marketplaces are geared towards individual homeowners with the capital to finance such changes. This online network makes the entire idea of switching to renewable energy more accessible for a variety of different organizations and groups.This easy access- and partnerships built between technical providers and financiers- will allow the idea of switching to renewable energy easier. We would first test the concept on a very small and localized scale. Using a lean start-up methodology of 'concierge service' where we will provide our service to a very small number of people- learn from this- iterate- and organically grow. To start- we would find 5 different types of consumers. Working exclusively with those groups/individuals- we would help them identify their best renewable energy options. Then we would reach out to current providers (and funders depending on the need) and facilitate that connection. From learning about this type of interaction with the customers- funders- and providers- we would then do a second iteration of this. During this time- we would also build a minimum viable product of a marketplace and start using this to facilitate those connections. This approach would allow us to learn and pivot accordingly. We would love to hear about:- attempts to do similar partnerships- including any models to specifically show - any alternative models or financing options to complete renewable energy projects. - examples of this in other sectors - specific groups/individuals/businesseswith whom that we could test this idea out- general feedback to build on this idea- different ways to test this A combination of various types of renewable energy An OpenIDEO Meetup,0,4,4,3,4,0

The basic premise is to have a label on food products (or any product) that quickly and simply shows how carbon intensive the product is.Like the organic labeling system- which allows consumers to make choices about how their food is raised- this label allows consumers to factor how green a product is into their decision making before they buy.It also allows companies that have gone to the extra trouble of becoming green to charge a premium for consumers who are willing to pay for their trouble. The labeling system could start with food and expand to other products.

3G9UA71JVV6YK9FH4V7IAHU99OU7JJ,3G9UA71JVV6YK9FH4V7IAHU99OU7JJ, A beautiful tree that generates wind energy used for public needs: street lighting- charge phones- provide wifi and music.A self-sustaining energy source for community building. The Wind Tree is ideal for developed urban settings. An ideal community for these trees could be Chicago - a city that combines affordability with desirability. Having wind- budget and taste for art- the city of Chicago is a great place to ‘plant’ these trees.However- we should not limit to windy cities- since these trees can work with very soft breezes (4mph). Considering that 88% of the US consumers prefer to use renewable electricity- these trees can work in basically any urban setting.People could use these trees for their community activities- taking advantage of the energy generated. Another key players are Universities. Students can gather around these Trees to study and do their activities. This Tree is the first real possibility to generate wind energy within a city on a large scale. By surpassing the three previously mentioned barriers- it helps communities rapidly transition to renewables.The more Giving Trees we ‘plant’ the more green energy will grow- replacing fossil fuels consumption. Having them on public spaces will also generate awareness of this issue. The original Wind Tree has been prototyped three times in France and during the upcoming months will launch to the market at a price of €29-500. Prototyping the Giving Tree as a whole won’t be cheap nor lightweight. But we could apply a more user-centered approach- checking out how people react to the aesthetics and uses of this tree- even though it’s not actually generating energy. After talking and surveying my classmates at Chicago Booth- I found out that not many would walk into the park just to sit next to this tree... but if the tree was located next to the (football) field then it would be really useful- both for them and for the people watching What other community activities could be done around these trees? This idea has been growing faster after different brainstorming sessions we had with Natalie (see attached pic)- if anyone is interested in joining the next session just let us know!

3GVPRXWRPH62PYVBMDMIYGF9W957I7,3GVPRXWRPH62PYVBMDMIYGF9W957I7, STG International is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to the premise that innovative- affordable- renewable energy is the only solution to the growing tension between the aspirations of the developing world and concerns over global climate change. We transfer technology and build capacity by establishing local partnerships that manufacture- own and operate novel distributed renewable energy infrastructure to provide an affordable distributed utility service to rural areas. There are many companies that offer energy products to off-grid communities but we represent something different: a micro-utility- a full scale replacement for a 24/7 reliable electrical grid- specifically for areas that the conventional grid may never reach. The lack of electricity infrastructure is especially apparent in rural communities. According to estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA)- only 14% of people living in rural Africa have access to electricity. This crucial infrastructure is needed by private households and it is essential as a multiplier for the effectiveness of institutions such as schools and health clinics that can otherwise only offer a bare minimum of services to their communities. Especially in regard to health institutions- the need for electricity is well understood: specialized medical diagnostic and treatment equipment (x-ray machines- blood analyzers- etc.)- computers- Electronic Medical Recordkeeping (EMR)- and telemedicine programs all depend on electricity. Supporting loads such as lighting (for increased hours of operation and security)- storage of medicines and vaccines- and the powering of staff quarters (which has implications for the attraction and retention of qualified professionals to work in remote areas)- are also basic requirements for effective health care.In addition to electricity- thermal energy plays a vital role for operations and hygiene in the form of cooling or heating the clinic facility and the providing of hot water – an aspect often overlooked in electrification programs. Common sense indicates that clinics and schools cannot operate effectively if the temperature rises above 90°F or drops below 50 °F- but little is currently done to systematically manage climate extremes when planning infrastructure upgrades.Based on published data- STG estimates that there are 80-000 health clinics and 260-000 schools worldwide that currently operate without electricity. The total value of this market is US $4.5B. To put the global market size in context- in Africa alone the market for diesel generators has been consistently growing at 30% per annum since 2006 and exceeded US $1 billion in 2007. This figure of course belies the real cost of diesel power generation- since the annual cost of fuel consumed by the installed base of generators is an order of magnitude greater than the annual capital investment- with estimates ranging between US$10-50 billion. Most off-grid communities in developing countries are dependent on kerosene lamps for lighting as well as batteries and diesel generators for powering basic appliances. The lack of proper access to energy sources forces communities to pay very high prices for electricity use despite the fact that most of these villages lie in areas with ideal resources for implementing affordable solar energy systems. STG’s approach is to help communities to bridge the gap between the feasibility of using renewable energy systems and the high capital cost that prevents their implementation with specialized off-grid technology and an innovative partnership model.Additionally- one of our core beliefs is that sustainability can only be secured in the long-term if the communities actively participate in the electrification process. Next to technology transfer and training of local employees- it is of great importance to us to not deliver our energy systems as a black box- but to invite members of the community to learn about the technology and to incorporate their suggestions into our design process at an early stage. STG International was founded on the basis of our experiences as volunteers in Lesotho- Africa. Throughout our work- we were able to gain extensive knowledge of the needs of underserved communities and therefore identified the lack of access to electricity as one of the main obstacles that stands in the way of delivering adequate education and healthcare as well as the building of infrastructure needed for economic development. After founding STG and designing our technology- we installed our first energy system at Matjoto health clinic in Lesotho. Over the course of this process- we established a local subsidiary- STG Lesotho- with several full-time employees- and cooperated with the Lesotho government to offer training and educational courses to students and the local population. The first installation of our energy system enabled us to gain valuable experiences on how to optimize our business plan and our technology. Based on these experiences- we feel confident to move to the next step and install our first- village-scale pilot systems to test and further advance our approach and our energy systems. One of the main reasons why we would like to become a member of OpenIDEO is its focus on community. Throughout our work in developing countries- we have seen that many projects are well-intended- but fail to succeed because the local population is not included in the process of finding and designing solutions to their pressing problems.STG’s approach is to put the community first and ask the local population about which services they need and how these services should be structured. Therefore- we look forward to sharing our approach with the OpenIDEO community and look forward to any suggestions- ideas or recommendations on how we can improve our technology and our interaction with communities.

3HEADTGN2P4HTNZQUYJ7IMW35NUVRQ,3HEADTGN2P4HTNZQUYJ7IMW35NUVRQ, How about we capture and utilize the kinetic energy (KE) we generate through locomotion. We can capture this energy and convert it to potential or electrical energy using a portable and wearable device (yet to be designed or developed). This can then be used to charge devices on the move. This idea can benefit both developing economies where there are many communities without sufficient supply of energy. In these communities- also- there is lots of human movement in the form of trekking running- farming- sports and so on. If this KE is harnessed- it will go a long way in cushioning the hardship of insufficient energy supply. This is also beneficial in developing worlds- where people mostly live a sedentary life. Overall- the3 areas of potential value creation of this idea are: (I)Energy Efficiency-(II) Health (keep fit! - you’re encouraged to move thus- jilt a sedentary lifestyle)(III) and of course- charging on the move (convenient!). The age groups this solution caters to cuts across all demographic and there is no limits to the education level either. Based on initial research- 30 minutes of human activity (running- gyming- jogging etc) can potentially generate up to 300watts in power if fully harnessed. This is enough energy to charge an average cell phone for 15 days (assuming the phone is charged to full capacity once a day) or an average laptop for 5 days (also- assuming the laptop is charged to full capacity once a day). These figures- are of course- estimates but they show at a high level- the enormous potential of energy that can be generated by harvesting our KE. Conduct a simple survey within the IE community and Madrid to ascertain if people would love to not worry about chargers- sockets- plugs etc when it comes to charging their devices. The success of this idea depends on the portability of this energy converter/storage device (simply a battery). It has to be simple- light-weight and easy to use because the customer will wear it as he/she moves about. As mentioned earlier- this device has not been designed nor developed- but- I strongly believe it is possible. I need people with technical science/engineering skills to evaluate the feasibility of creating such a device and advise accordingly- bearing in mind the criteria outlined above.

3HUR21WDDU1IUDG788CJE3MLOLHXYX,3HUR21WDDU1IUDG788CJE3MLOLHXYX, No matter where you live- electric power is needed when an emergency happens. Power is essential for emergency response operations involving communications- fire and police stations- command and control centers- hospitals- water and sewer plants- water pumping- elevators- fuel pumps- medical equipment- refrigeration- heating- and for so many other types critical- electronic equipment. Solar plus energy storage for critical community facilities—fire- police- emergency shelters- as well as power protection for affordable and elderly housing facilities—is the technology innovation with the greatest potential to expand community-based renewable power to scale across the US in the years ahead. All members of a community can benefit from distributed- resilient power solutions like solar+storage located at critical facilities and community shelters. Other who could benefit are vulnerable populations including the disabled- elderly and the poor- if resilient power solutions are incorporated into their buildings and facilities. If these facilities remain “powered” during a long duration power outage- residents will not have to be moved- their ability to charge medical and mobility devices will remain- refrigeration and heating systems will be powered- and they could ride out the outage by sheltering in place. As communities start to prepare of the effects of climate change and energy assurance- the ability to deploy clean- reliable- renewable energy solutions should be at the top of the list. How and where solar+storage technologies can keep emergency management and response systems powered should be incorporated into new community planning discussions and resilience plans.In a blueprint for how a community could become more “power resilient-” Clean Energy Group produced a report- Clean Energy for Resilient Communities- which shows how the City of Baltimore and other cities could use clean energy to create a more reliable electric system that protects vulnerable citizens during power blackouts. The report is the first in-depth review of national policies and finance strategies to use solar and energy storage to provide more power protection in an urban setting. The report says that critical public facilities like hospitals- fire stations- gas stations- community shelters- and schools should use more resilient power technologies to protect people during power outages. The report also recommends new business models and highlights the emergence of companies that now sell solar with battery storage services to customers—to address the overlooked problem of stand-alone PV systems not working during power outages. See http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/2014-Files/Clean-Energy-for-Resilient-Communities-Report-Feb2014.pdf.In order for this transition to succeed- community leaders need more information about how these technologies will work and how they can finance them. Developers need to understand how to incorporate these technologies into their plans and how to communicate the benefits to communities. As communities- such as those in Massachusetts- start to deploy solar+storage technologies- Clean Energy Group needs to work find out what challenges they faced- how they overcame those challenges- and then provide these lessons-learned to other communities who are moving in the same direction. Installations of solar+storage technologies can accelerate renewable energy markets. If more communities install solar+storage technologies in place of diesel generators- more resilient- clean and reliable power will be provided during power outages. If these systems are sized to provide power to larger loads all of the time- communities will decrease their reliance on fossil fuels and drive the market demand for solar and storage technologies. This increased demand should result in lower costs as these markets achieve scale. The more renewable energy technologies are deployed- the greater our ability to meet the challenges of climate change. As a society- the move the domestic- distributed energy production in renewable energy will also have economic- health- and other societal benefits at the local and national level. What many people who install gird-connected solar PV equipment on their homes fail to realize is that in most cases- if the grid goes down- there solar panels can no longer supply electricity to their homes. With solar+storage systems- additional equipment is deployed that would allow the home to disconnect from the grid during a power outage and continue to generate power that the homeowner can use. The same goes for business and other facilities. Adding storage to a system moves the solar equipment to a new level – with the ability to provide power during an outage.With steadily dropping costs in both solar and energy storage technologies- solar+storage has become a viable and more reliable choice for emergency power. Not only do solar+storage systems have the ability to provide power indefinitely when the grid is unavailable- they can also cut costs and generate revenue during the 99.9% of the time when the grid is functioning normally. In many cases- these savings and revenue streams can drastically reduce the payback period of an energy storage system. These technologies can provide clean energy- possible revenues- and more energy security to communities. As part of the Resilient Power Project- Clean Energy Group has created a small technical assistance fund to help communities analyze these options as part of our Resilient Power Project- with funding from several foundations. But the demand is great to work with more communities across the country. In addition- to get to scale- new forms of financing mechanisms are needed to aggregate projects and bring in lower cost capital to reduce project costs for communities. Our Resilient Power Project is addressing the challenges to widespread deployment of these technologies. We have recently published a report- “Financing for Resilient Power Solutions” that can be downloaded at http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/CEG-Financing-for-Resilient-Power.pdf. Solar+storage is a hybrid innovation that benefits customers directly- so it is not dependent solely on the environmental attributes of the technology- but rather follows the “disruptive technology” path of cheaper- smaller and more effective technologies that will upset the established grid status quo more rapidly than a pure subsidy based model. Clean Energy Group is working with leading community developers to install these technologies now in affordable housing communities across the country. We have a special interest in multifamily housing for low income and elderly residents- as well as assisted living and supportive housing and community facilities.We are beginning to see multifamily projects develop clean distributed generation combined with storage (resilient power) to protect low-income and vulnerable populations from extreme weather-related power outages that can last for weeks at a time.We are not a developer or finance institution. But we work with those entities- and we provide technical services and possible funding for predevelopment costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects. In addition to providing support to developers of affordable multifamily housing and community facilities- we are working with local agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in low income communities throughout extended power disruptions.Clean Energy Group is also working to create a network of state and municipal officials across the country to address climate adaptation and resilience. We are partnering with state agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in communities throughout extended power disruptions.We and our partners can help state energy assurance planners to craft policy through our information sharing- best practices and research- and by sharing our experience and contacts. Clean Energy Group can also provides technical services and some funding for pre-development costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects. We would love working with the OpenIDEO community on clean energy deployment and an information sharing platform to distribute our free reports- concept notes- webinars and newsletters on resilient power to those who would be interested in that information.

3I7SHAD35M8OLHL27SKAQ9MQDIP7MN,3I7SHAD35M8OLHL27SKAQ9MQDIP7MN, To bring citizens--US & worldwide--into the conversion to renewable energy process- we need Small Vertical Solar Units. (Think of them as sort of like R2-D2s- but different.) These units could be mass produced- & purchased & installed in backyards & on building tops everywhere. Their solar cells would go up vertically- not horizontally- and work all day long--if designed to follow the sun--to produce a small-but-significant percentage of the electricity needs of- especially- households. Since they could be purchased & installed at relatively small cost- additional units could be purchased--or rented--& installed almost without limit- until- theoretically- allhousehold--& EV automobile--electricity needs are met. Heights would vary. This idea benefits citizens everywhere- in an immediate- financial sense; but also it would benefit citizens everywhere in that it would greatly reduce the burning of coal and other fossil fuels for electrical power. It would make small- vertical solar units affordable to everyday citizens. Anyone with a small space open to the sun would be able immediately to cut down on the electric bill- and help battle climate change. Probably none. We live in an apartment in the city- and I do not have a shop for experimentation. I would like to be included in the think tank for developing the idea- as I have certain designs in mind and just love the idea- but I am not concerned with idea proprietorship or other personal gain.

3INZSNUD802PV63I9WJRLFQ2ZULD9N,3INZSNUD802PV63I9WJRLFQ2ZULD9N, The SunSaluter (www.sunsaluter.com) is a solar panel rotator designed for the developing world. Using only gravity and water- the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to rotate and follow the sun throughout the day- boostingefficiency by 30%. It also produces clean water!The SunSaluter is built from common components and is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized panel rotators (called trackers)- and is much more durable without complex components.Solar power is a proven way to alleviate energy poverty- but it is simply still too expensive for many poor consumers. By increasing efficiency and lowering the overall cost per watt- the SunSaluter can help communities afford the transition to clean energy! The SunSaluter is ideal for poor- rural individuals living without electricity. These individuals earn just dollars a day and often spend more than 20% of their income on kerosene gas and walk hours just to charge their cell phones. Solar energy is a great tool for eliminating these problems- but it is often still too expensive up-front for them. By boosting efficiency and lowering the cost per watt of solar energy- the SunSaluter brings solar energy within reach. For example- a 150 watt solar lantern charging station which powers 75 lanterns can be outfitted with a SunSaluter to be capable of charging 25 more lanterns. The individuals living in unelectrified communities also often lack access to clean water- so the SunSaluter provides a great additional benefit.For example- at the OneMama Clinic in Kirindi- Uganda- a SunSaluter installation has allowed women at the health clinic to not only eliminate the usage of kerosene- but to create a phone charging business to bolster their income.“The mamas are so excited that this is bringing light into an area where they spend the most time- which is in the Kitchen area- and also bringing energy for them to charge cell phones and purifying water- so we’re using it for tea and for cooking dinner. The OneMama Clinic is very grateful to SunSaluter for bringing its wonderful technology to the OneMama Clinic and to Uganda.”- Siobhan Neilland- Founder of OneMama By boosting the efficiency of solar panels by 30%- the SunSaluter lowers the overall cost per watt of solar energy and simply makes it more affordable. Excellent solar technology is already available in many markets - but cost is still a primary barrier to widespread adoption. The SunSaluter is also unique in that it be installed with new solar systems or used to retrofit existing systems. With over 2 gigawatts of off-grid solar capacity currently installed worldwide- the solar infrastructure upon which to use the SunSaluter already exists- and is growing every day. The SunSaluter is simple to build and requires no special equipment nor training- meaning any community can adopt it rapidly. Lastly- if we can get local entrepreneurs to manufacture and distribute their own SunSaluters- costs will decrease dramatically and hopefully instill confidence in the community to adopt the technology. We have already deployed over 100 SunSaluters around the world - and every time we learn something new! Regarding outsourced manufacturing- we are beginning to work with a village in northern India where the locals will build their own SunSaluters and can either use them- sell them- or resell them back to us to provide our other customers. We will be making at least 30 systems with them in the coming months- and would really love to learn how to make the process beneficial to everyone involved. We are happy to try any suggestions that people have. And of course we're open to trying this approach with other partners around the world! We would be grateful for any recommendations on how to set up a human-centered manufacturing and distribution partnership with these communities. What can we do to make sure it is beneficial to the community members- but also ensure standards of quality and reliability for us? What should we make sure not to do? Are there any partner organizations that you recommend that we work with? And of course- any technical or design suggestions are always welcome too - thank you! Solar An Individual,0,4,4,5,5,0
3J94SKDEKI16UJ16666A9ZL0DY2D5W,3J94SKDEKI16UJ16666A9ZL0DY2D5W, The suggested model creates an opportunity for individuals and communities to earn money- gives flexibility to the consumers to buy only as much energy as he might require and ensures availability of energy for everybody all the time.To execute the model- the owners of residential houses and commercial buildings install a device (eg: Solar panels) to generate the renewable energy. Their respective energy needs are satisfied by the energy generated by this device and the unused energy is sold to the power distributors. Anybody who is in need of energy can buy it from power distributors. Public transportation- small and large scale industries are some example organizations who might want to buy energy from the power distributors. The idea benefits all stakeholders. Main Players: 1)Residential communities: Anybody irrespective of income- education- sex- age can invest in the renewable energy generating device and participate in the process 2)Commercial buildings: Buildings like government office- private office- shopping malls etc can invest in the device that generates energy from renewable resource and participate in the process 3)Government: The government body must play a regulatory role in the process 4)Power distributors: Government can create a division which acts like a power distributor. Experiments can be carried out to verify the following assumptions: 1)People are willing to contribute to the mission ‘green earth’. 2)Technology can be twisted or re-engineered to accommodate the changes made in the process.First experiment can be carried out to verify the technical capability of the devices and setup. This can be done by making prototypes with the help of electrical engineers.Once the first experiment is successful- second experiment can be carried out in a small town with a reasonable number of people. Ideally the town should have both residential and commercial communities.

3K3G488TR2K0JS5BBSCU9YSZWDR5QT,3K3G488TR2K0JS5BBSCU9YSZWDR5QT, In the Kafue Plains of Zambia- where fishing is the predominant means of generating income- fishing communities need an efficient way to keep their catch cold until its sold.Ice blocks are currently the most common method of preserving and storing fish- but this method is inefficient and impractical. In response to this problem- Kafue resident Mr. Robert Shimaingo- has designed and developed an underwater- dam-free turbine that that will harness energy from the flowing river to power a cold storage unit for the fishermen in the region to preserve and store their fish. The turbine harnesses natural energy that is abundant and accessible through most of Zambia. As many as half of local residents of Kafue earn their living from fishing but prices must be slashed when the fish cannot be kept cold. The power generated by Robert's turbine is intended for a refrigeration system that will enable fish caught locally to be stored and sold at the best price. Currently- people in the Kafue region use ice blocks that are frozen in other regions and transported to the rivers to store fish. This has proven to be inefficient and results in many of the fish becoming rotten. Through this technology- they will be able to minimize food waste with reliable electricity that is cleanly produced. Robert Shimaingo has already started testing a prototype in the region.However- the prototype still needs to be improved to reach the necessary power requirements. Drawings and technical specifications are also a future challenge. - How to improve the prototype - How to connect Robert Shimaingo with other people interested in the technology - Other communities that could benefit from this technology - How to scale the technology A type of energy not listed An Individual,0,4,4,4,4,0

While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea. Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union. The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy. My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing. One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community. I would love to learn more about this kind of social dynamic. Solar An Individual,0,3,2,3,4,0
3L21G7IH478A4CVE1FRCJUIKJ62Y16,3L21G7IH478A4CVE1FRCJUIKJ62Y16, If we are to reach our carbon neutral goals- the development of Palo Alto’s EcoDistricts will be the tool by which we facilitate community-level engagement in sustainability initiatives-identify existing community resources and opportunities; leverage these assets and opportunities; and through behavior-change science mobilize our residents.Eco-Districts will provide the format by which the city acts as a laboratory for sustainable technologies- policies- and planning. There are people in each neighborhood of our community who are ready to step-up and lead others into amore sustainable lifestyle.Through the formation of Ecodistricts and this process of engagement The City can empower these individuals to do just that.The best part of this approach is that it allows each neighborhood (and block even) to decide what they want to focus on- whether it's shared solar purchasing- energy efficiency competitions- or planting an edible garden- the important thing is that the citizens who want to be engaged have a process- a pathway to ease implementation and a partnership from their City government. Our community is unique in that it owns its' own utility which already provides 100% carbon neutral electricity.This is to say that we are now turning the focus towards the elimination of natural gas in our community.This will require more fuel switching or switching over to renewable electricity.In order to effectively meet the goal of a carbon neutral city- we need the participation of everyone in our city.We need renewable energy- energy efficiency and carbon neutrality to be integrated into the running of each household and business here.The setting up Eco-Districts allows us to rapidly transition to meeting our bold goals because it is a process that engages EVERYONE block by block.Block Leaders will be empowered with tools to lead their neighborhood into a carbon neutral future. A first step would be to mock up a sustainable neighborhood toolkit for our city (many cities have them... see the City of St. Lois or the City of Toronto for some good examples.)With that in hand- we could begin to explore how one of our civic leaders or self-chosen block captains would like to begin engaging with their neighbors.Theprocess of engagement can be a collaborative- emergent process that fits the leadership style of the individual.Once the mock-up tool kit and engagement process is vetted by our top community leader(s)- we could begin by doing a pilot ofONE block or a slightly larger pilot could be to focus on the downtown as the first Ecodistrict. Skills and input around the community engagement and outreach process- the building of the sustainable neighborhood toolkit- as well as innovative financing ideas for district level projects would all be very helpful.

We identify- train and support women as entrepreneurs to sell portable solar PV lighting and mobile charging solutions to their last mile customers in Nepal.The widespread use of cell-phones in developing countries willenable us to reach distant markets and electrify one third of the world's population living in energy poverty. Nepal’s entire population is under electrified- with 60% percent not even connected to the unreliable electric grid. Empower Generation serves rural households that typically spend around 10% of their income on harmful and ineffective lighting- like kerosene lanterns. Rural women bear the brunt of energy poverty in Nepal- as they are responsible for obtaining basic fuels and providing energy services to the family. With limited or no career options- women are often confined to these traditional tasks. Empower Generation offers women life-changing careers providing vital energy services to local communities. Empower Generation is a lean- global team that works with local stakeholders to catalyze energy access. Our local women-entrepreneurs are the main players. We also work closely with local community organizations and financial institutions- mobile money service providers- and solar power system designers and manufacturers. Solar power is available- affordable and reliable – the obstacles lie in financing and distribution for under-electrified rural communities. Our model empowers local women to become a part of our solar distribution franchise and sustainably deliver power to the last mile. With the convenience of mobile payments paired with mobile-controlled systems- EG entrepreneurs can offer customers high-quality- efficient solar power systems for their homes in exchange for monthly payments. With mobile money- entrepreneurs and agents will be able to collect monthly payments easily even when customers are hard-to-reach. We are ready to pilot our PAYG solar-home-system and mobile payment platform within our existing distribution network of 7 women-led solar businesses and expand it to our 2015 class of 10 entrepreneurs later this year. With an expanded customer base- more enterprises and a mobile marketing campaign EG will be able to build on our existing model of women-led distributed energy services to offer more customers more power and appliances with built-in financing. •Mobile money + telecommunications partners/advisors•App/backend software developers/advisors•Consumer electronics specialists to help us integrate PAYG technology- solar power components and appliances into a compelling package •PAYG technology sourcing partners•Training programs for solar installation/maintenance partners/advisors •Customer Financing/Impact investment/Program-Related-Investment Solar A Group Brainstorm,0,3,4,3,4,0

3N7PQ0KLI5188AS2OIT10K51ZEC3EP,3N7PQ0KLI5188AS2OIT10K51ZEC3EP, Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike. Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount. Every time the pasteurize using our cow-poop powered system- they prevent methane emissions and make more money.Industrial milk producers - Most milk is processed at large processing plants which are huge energy hogs. We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine. Save calves through affordable milk pasteurization.Others - We are also looking at raw milk- home cheesemakers- and others. By embedding renewables within the dairy system- we change the renewables challenge and value proposition by making it one component of an income-generating product. Users can produce more electricity than they need- so they can also retail electricity to neighbors and others. We have talked to farmers in Costa Rica- China- and the US and we think there is a real need for our product. We do not yet have FDA approval for our new technology and one question we are trying to answer is if people in under-regulated markets will accept our technology (eg. small rural farmers in emerging economies- aged cheesemakers- raw milk drinkers- others) before we go through this long process. For the US- we are testing this now. We need to ask the same of people in emerging markets. Help us design a product that fits into the way that people make milk and manage manure now.Also- help us get perspective on our ideas about emerging market opportunities- spoilage- and on-farm milk pasteurization. Though we are close to markets in California- we don't have as much perspective on emerging markets. Biofuels A Student Collaboration,0,4,3,4,5,0

It allows users to- at a glance- see a live reading of your usage by converting your kilowatts to currency; compare usage with similar households (based on individual user profiles- linked to social media etc); and allows for deeper insights into possible energy savings with alternative providers/sources (based on neighbour usage). It is designed to be used across the whole community- irrespective of social-economic status- including education and financial situation. By designing an app that can be used on a smartphone- computer or smart TV- we are able to cover large sections of the community. We are seeking to capitalise on the abundance of data available already from our smart meters to better inform the consumer about making renewable energy choices.Open source development would be an ideal way to roll out a testing stage of this app. The Power Portal empowers the consumer through transparency and knowledge about there energy usage by promoting an organic switch to renewable sources.In turn- this creates a groundswell of community understanding and agency- which can be used to put pressure on big business. After all- if there is enough demand- the bigger power businesses will feel the pressure to stay relevant to there market. This will drive a rapid change in delivering renewable power to your doorstep. Stage 1 By gaining access to the Smart meter we can quickly and easily see users consumption instantly. We then need to make sense of this data and convert it into meaningful graphics/visualsthat are easy to understand.Stage 2 Taking theinformation from the users bill and the the energy companies Kilowatt usage costs. We can start to build a picture of what the live cost of the households consumption is right away. Stage 3 Find out what information users would like to see- how they would like to see it & how often they want to see it.

3OKP4QVBP296C9NE3SYZNV4JI4JAG9,3OKP4QVBP296C9NE3SYZNV4JI4JAG9, Across the Northeast- hundreds of thousands of buildings still use fuel oil to produce heat and hot water. The collective soot- carbon dioxide and other pollutants that come out of these buildings' smokestacks have dire implications for public health and climate change. In urbanized areas- installing solar hot water systems on residential buildings makes much more sense than PV panels from an environmental- economic- and public health standpoint.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that deploying solar heating on NYC buildings that burned the dirtiest fuel oil could reduce GHG emission by 260-000 tons- particulate matter emissions by 1-800 tons- and nitrogen oxide emissions by 13-500 tons each year. Because soot is a known trigger for asthma attacks- installing solar hot water systems in lower-income communities that suffer high asthma rates is particular urgent. Northeastern state and local governments need to eliminate barriers and put in place the right incentives to promote the installation of SHW systems.Our children and our planet will thank them for it.

Our approach connects personalized energy experts who are workers at electricity grids or members of an organization such as LEED to families based on regions and socio-economic class. The expert could hold monthly meetings to provide information about energy and new low cost technologies that could help them save their energy consumption and identify a monthly target for each house.

3PN6H8C9R4230PDN12XRHA1M5C3ADZ,3PN6H8C9R4230PDN12XRHA1M5C3ADZ, We believe that everyone should have the ability to support clean energy.So we created a new way for people to take action.It's a pretty simple idea actually. We raise money through crowdfunding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations and worker-owned cooperatives.As these organizations pay us back- we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.It's a pay-it-forward model for community solar.We call it the Solar Seed Fund.Learn more at www.solarseedfund.org and www.re-volv.org! The Solar Seed Fund benefits everyone by helping nonprofits and cooperatives that serve their community go solar. The avoided carbon emissions help alleviate climate change- and seeing solar panels on the rooftops of beloved community organizations inspires community members to go solar at home. But even if someone can't go solar at home- they can chip in and support the Solar Seed Fund and know that they are actively creating climate solutions. Every dollar donated is a vote for a clean energy future.Small community-based nonprofits and cooperatives often want to go solar to save money and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. However- due to their tax structure- credit rating- and the size of their projects- they often can’t find solar financing.RE-volv makes going solar easier for these organizations by offering low-cost financing through hassle-free lease agreements. In addition- through RE-volv's educational outreach programs- these community organizations are helping to raise awareness about solar energy among the people they serve. RE-volv’s main objective is to implement renewable energy projects in communities that can’t afford them. Nonprofits and cooperatives that serve as the backbone of our communities are often left without financing options for solar energy. Through its revolving fund model- RE-volv is able to provide access to solar to those who previously didn’t have it.RE-volv’s programs are uniquely designed to increase civic participation. Traditional solar financing comes from a few big banks and financial institutions. RE-volv turns this model on its head.RE-volv gives every single person the ability to help support building local solar projects. This way- each person can take action on climate change and participate in creating a more sustainable community.Through this community participatory finance model- RE-volv creates localized- renewable power generation and green jobs through its solar installations. So far- we've crowdfunded two projects successfully and are currently in the middle of our third crowdfunding campaign. You can check it out at www.solarseedfund.org! Lease payments from the first two projects have lowered the amount we need to crowdfund for our current project by $7-008. Soon we will launch our own crowdfunding platform giving donors the ability to view a portfolio of the projects they’ve supported and the environmental impact they’ve had. With the new platform we’ll be experimenting with functionality to find out what are the key features to foster engagement on the site. We need to expand the Solar Seed Fund network and take our model to scale. We're going to be launching our own crowdfunding platform soon and we want to know from you- the community- how we can make this an interactive and empowering way for people to support clean energy. What can we incorporate to get people excited about supporting solar? Solar An Individual,0,4,3,4,4,0

Targets affluent communities that seek to live in energy efficient housing projects and builds awareness that subsequently passes onto other communities. This could be implemented in projects being undertaken in an energy conscious community for e.g.: part of construction of hotel resort in Dubai. Main players include end customer- real estate developer- project contractor and local energy utility company.

3SD15I2WD264VVZNI0A3OWDOIGO364,3SD15I2WD264VVZNI0A3OWDOIGO364, A new pilot program will be tested in select suburban cities with current solar customers that allows them to come together as catalysts of change in the movement towards clean renewable energy. Current solar owners will be invited to an appreciation event in which they will be given greater insight into the vision of what a world with clean energy will look like. This event- co-hosted by non-profits and solar companies- will help each solar owner engage their close social networks to share this vision- opening with the simple question How can we better improve our neighborhood and invite their neighbors- friends- family and colleagues to a block party exploring their collection of ideas- with solar as one of the suggestions to explore. The main players are suburban neighborhoods- solar companies and non-profits working to discover the needs of a community. Through this program- community stakeholders- like local businesses- city councils and schools- can be included overtime as ideas for neighborhood improvements arise from the opportunity events. For example- in my own community- a high concern is crime and a great solution that does not require added financial investment is engaging neighbors in starting a neighborhood watch. This has already happened in certain parts of our city- but is not universally practiced. Ironically- it is a simple invitation to an event and a willing host that sparks solution in communities and engages citizens into the development of a community. Going solar can become associated with a neighborhood that is well-connect and united in their values. Truly- while going solar initially has been a greatbenefit to individuals families- as the movement builds- it can be seen as an unexpected catalyst for change. Their choice to going solar turns into them becoming invited into a greater movement- getting to know their neighbors- and gaining a new sense of purpose and hope for their community. This choice creates a greater push force in our communities to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. We no longer see it as a choice for us to make individually- but an opportunity for us to rediscover our shared challenges- opportunities and values. As current solar employees and knowing several solar customers- we can enroll these customers into the idea and engage non-profits about the idea for the program. Finding a small suburban neighborhood with a high density of customers- at least 20 people who have gone solar-to pilot this program is possible. At first- the events will have to be provided by the employees and non-profit- but as long as we provide and track data about the rate of conversion to solar around the homes in the neighborhood- it could possibly start a pilot program that successfully creates the transition of solar systems to a retail product to an entry point towards a movement. This idea was sparked by a conversation among solar sales employees who want to try new ways in engaging the customer base and overcoming our greatest obstacles. This pilot program is meant to diversify the strategies and types of interactions that motivate people to going solar. California is at the forefront of solar with the recent announcement from Jerry Brown with the states commitment to 50% renewable energy generation by 2030. We envision this program to begin in the suburban areas of Los Angeles County- where cities are small in population and the population is highly diverse. Collaboration from non-profits with presentations they already use to engage people about the positive vision of what renewable energy and solar can mean for our communities. Insight from current solar companies of the financial resources they can convert towards a pilot program or third-party non-profit that can test this idea.

Deaths from coal mining and power plants far- far outnumber all nuclear power-related deaths.Yet archaic fact myths fuel opposition to nuclear power- which currently provides 65% of our clean energy.Nuclear is needed to address climate change in the time frame and at the scale we need.We need to remember who the real enemy is (fossil fuels and carbon emissions) and allow nuclear energy to be on the team that is working to save the planet. We may even like 4th generation new nukes! This idea benefits everyone because it hurts fossil fuels.Individuals and community leaders should demand that local and national environment groups accept nuclear as a part of the necessary transition to clean energy as a solution to climate change.Listen to the many experts who support nuclear and stop trying to close nuclear power plants. Instead demand more accountability from federal regulators and regional power industry professionals.Evaluate new nuclear technologies and learn the real facts : don't allow myths to make you harbor unrealistic fear of something that you have a near zero risk of injury from.Work together to support smart nuclear policies to help diminish the economic and political power of hostile fossil fuel interests- who are successfully buying our elections and holding our politicians hostage.With every nuclear power plant that staying in operation- re-opens or is built- we keep oil and gas from replacing that energy and force oil and gas to keep those fossil fuels in the ground- where they are needed.By the way- here is a list (created by the Breakthrough Institute plus some) of people who already support the need for more nuclear power.President Barack Obama-Ansel Adams-Paul Allen-Steward Brand-Sir Richard Branson- The Breakthrough Institute-Carol Browner-Dr. Stephen Chu-Gwyneth Cravens-The Dalai Lama-Jared Diamond-Senator Al Franken-Bill Gates-Dr. James Hansen-John Holdren-Dr. James Lovelock-Dr. Jane Long-Mark Lynas-George Monbiot-Hugh Montefiore-Richard Rhodes-Jeffrey Sachs-Stephen Tindale-. . . and many more This idea empowers communities to aggressively seek renewable energy while also having as back-up a clean energy source that reliability backs up their renewable power.Currently our major source of reliableback-up power is coal and gas.Dependable energy storage is still a long ways off. Nuclear power can be designed to supplant fossil fuels now but to operate at reduced levels when not needed to support community energy needs.Nuclear makes full-implementation of renewable power feasible- since all renewable power is still intermitten in nature and is not enough by itself- such as when it rains- at night- when there is no wind- and when there is peak demand- etc. without the need to resort to burning coal.NUCLEAR POWER IS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL AND WE NEED TO ALLOW IT TO CO-EXIST UNTIL WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUT SUFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY. I am looking to organize a summit of environmental leaders and pro-nuclear leaderswho recognize that fossil fuels are the real enemy in our climate-threatened world.I would like this summit to air legitimate grievances with nuclear power and address realistic solutions that could enable nuclear power to regain acceptance by environmental groups as well as the broader general public.This summit should present credible experts and allow for real debate by participants.Let's be sure that we have left no stone unturned (or feasible technology unexplored) in our search for rapid solutions to our climate crisis.It would be my hope that this summit could result in a statement of acceptance of a nuclear roadmap by the collective group prior to the Paris COP- that could help provide meaningful solutions for countries seeking to make ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by 2020 and onward. I am calling this the Silver Bullet Summit and I need help getting financial and organizational support for this summit from foundations and non-profits and determining the key environmental leaders and experts to bring together for this life and planet-saving summit to be held in the late fall of 2015.I am at an early stage of conceptual development- and starting to prepare materials for it but I would love to have more people interested in working on this with me to make it happen.

3UEDKCTP9V2TVTLZMG7UBWUMODU7KI,3UEDKCTP9V2TVTLZMG7UBWUMODU7KI, As a Materials engineer- I've always been fascinated on how playing with materials and discovering new ways to use them can be a revelation and change the world with them (Eg: Silicium revolution- Eg. Maybe Graphene? ). But there are MANY other examples. Window glasses that change their optical properties depending on the temperature- so to be extremely energy efficient.Conductive Inks that can just be printed- saving millions of chips waste.Adaptable airplane wings (profiting from Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) properties) that would mimic birds flight to be totally aerodinamic.And the list continues.So my idea is also focusing in the way materials themselves can contribute to the better profit of energy. People who like research and experimenting. Anyone can- but mostly engineers and chemists. Renewable energy is not just focused in producing energy- but profiting it the best way possible.

Working on a roster all signed up members do the whole communities errands in one go- rather than everyone doing their own.This gives a two short/medium term objectives and one longer term objective: 1) Cut down emissions of burnt fossil fuels2) Everyone signed up contributes the money they have saved on petrol or Diesel into the long term gain pot3) The long term gain pot will be used to purchase an Electric vehicle for the errand run for the future. Mostly communities that use private transport for all errand runs- therefore a fairly wide demographic. The idea would likely have higher benefit for communities that have more disparate resources- therefore longer journeys for errands. Short term gains- mean that less fossil fuel is used in everyday life- longer term gains greatly improve that with the introduction of EVs (Electric Vehicles). Exposure to using an EV in this way may also encourage users to be more inclined to replace their own fossil fuel vehicles with a capable EV. To understand how this might fly would be to get some understanding of the interest locally of environmental concerns and how many members of the community would be interested in participating in the scheme. Input of validity in people's time and mileage spent on errand runs that could be added to a community roster would start to flesh out the amount of mileage/money that could be saved in a sizeable community and therefore some ideas could be formed around time to purchase for the EV. This would give some validity or not to the communities ability to participate and achieve the longer term gain. Electric vehicles An Individual,0,1,1,2,2,0

We want to create an app that helps to connect everyday actions with climate impacts on a personal level. This idea could potentially benefit every human on planet Earth if it helps to build awareness about climate change and the need for renewable energy. But on a more reasonable scale- interested smartphone users could benefit by becoming more educated about how their daily lives impact the environment. This app could also be brought into schools to more viscerally educate students about climate change and renewable energy.The potential main players are app developers- smartphone users- and schools.

3VCK0Q0PO5QGLO6IYUE1O913AUT0NG,3VCK0Q0PO5QGLO6IYUE1O913AUT0NG, Create a website that tests the energy efficiency of consumer products- sells the best of them- rejects those that don't meet the standards and educates consumers about which is best to buy in terms of energy usage. This benefits consumers looking for energy related information for the products they're buying and the manufacturersof energy efficient products. This would focus on targeting educated consumers in developed countries first. The site would gain traction by first finding groups that are already advocates with money to spend a little extra on energy efficient products. Then it would rely on educating additional- more mainstream consumers to continue growing.Manufacturer's will also want to cooperate by providing the information about the energy used to produce or dispose of the products to gain access to the marketplace. If they truly have made improvements- they will want to show the proof of that. It allows for energy efficiency to be a main consideration when buying new products. We can be sure that millions of people will continue to buy tons of stuff years into the future. We can also be sure that businesses will continue to sell millions of products too. It will be easier to slightly adjust that behavior than to make large changes to it. If consumers demand more energy efficient products- then businesses will clamor over themselves to meet that demand- profitably. That will help reduce the energy demand world-wide- and allow renewable energy sources to provide a larger percentage of energy. Go out into stores where people buy these products and talk to them. Watch them as they decide which appliance to purchase. Start with people who care about the issue and then broaden to the main-stream. Show them mockups and prototypes in the store of sample energy scores for the products they're considering and explore whether that affects their decision of which to buy. Experiment with educating consumers about specific aspects of the issue and then exploring whether that affects their purchase decision. Talk to manufactures and explore how likely they would be to make changes to their products knowing that there is a growing consumer demand for those changes. What can manufactures do to make products more energy efficient? What types of products can we include in this? How to we evolve this from being focused just on reducing energy use to producing products that create renewable energy? A combination of various types of renewable energy An Individual,0,3,2,4,3,0

3X4Q1O9UBHYCLK6EK8ZNIDBV8I47O2,3X4Q1O9UBHYCLK6EK8ZNIDBV8I47O2, While many cities and companies are looking for ways to become more environmentally friendly- most are limiting their efforts to simply reducing consumption.NetPlus envisions a movement- powered by public-private partnerships and systems building- that inspires individuals- communities- and businesses into net producers of energy.This is accomplished by a combination of implementing best practices for reducing the need for energy consumption- while focussing on the opportunities for energy generation. Mostly school communities in urban/rural areas. The main players are the school administration- teachers- parents- students- local power company and local government. Benefits concentric communities centered around schools. Changing the way children interact and learn about renewable energy- making it an inherent part of their everyday life- will also lead to educating their parents and in turn theentire community around them. DIY projects in the classroom: building your own solar backpack- creating soccer balls and footballs that create energy- plans for farmers markets and community vegetable garden that can be used for school lunchesBring in different members of the community to speak to children about their own experiences and open their eyes to the world of sustainability outside the classroom walls. It’d be beneficial to speak with:- Members of a school system who are also interested in this topic and how it can be applied in the community and classroom - Schools that are already committed to some sort of energy reducing program - Designers who have worked on kinetic playgrounds- Those who frequent farmers markets and/or have helped set one up - Members of community gardens who can speak to the setup- amount of work- maintenance- etc. A combination of various types of renewable energy A Group Brainstorm,0,2,3,4,2,0
3XEDXEGFX30FDILF1HMLWHKZGZO0KB,3XEDXEGFX30FDILF1HMLWHKZGZO0KB, PEM fuel cells (PEMFC) and their hydrogen fuel requirement are struggling to compete with current energy options (gasoline- natural gas- hybrid electric). To overcome these competitors- reductions in the cost of manufacturing as well as improved efficiency and range of operating conditions need to be addressed. Hydrogen production costs and handling also will require reductions to the scale that petroleum refineries enjoy today. The Honda fuel cell FCX Clarity vehicle is rated at 59 mpg-e (mile per gallon equivalent to gasoline). If outfitted with the proposed enhanced fuel cell membranes the mileage would increase to 82.6 mpg-e. A report by Transparency Market Research states the global fuel cells market was valued at US$355.3 million in 2011 and is projected to grow to US$910.3 million by 2018 led by the stationary segment expected to reach a market size of $4.17 billion by 2019.The initial target market is MEA manufacturers serving the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) segment- specifically those operating at low temperature in small stationary- transportation and portable applications. The market was selected because the technology has the greatest known impact on systems operating at low temperatures. Widespread use of PEMFC technology is due to low operating temperature- rapid start up capabilities- favorable power density/size ratio and the ability to vary output in matching power demand shifts also favored selection of this market.PEMFC is the most dominant form of fuel cell- accounting for over 40% of global installed capacity and close to 88% market share in 2013. Applications include forklifts- automobiles- telecommunications- data centers- primary and backup power systems.MEA manufacturers will be critical users of the process method integrated/outsourced with their existing or potential high throughput capabilities that would drive additional cost reduction requirements of supported catalyst manufacture. Target companies also harbor relationships with PEMFC manufacturers critical in understanding industry component development needs- providing performance validation and cost reductions facilitating widespread adaption of the product. Customer interviews identified that catalysts have to be more resistant to CO- which the technology achieves by reducing the impact of CO introduced by the ambient air supply to the operating environment.The true value resides in increased power output capabilities. For example- a 3kW fuel cell system without the enhancement costs $14-800 or $4-933/kW. With the enhancement- the system output would increase to 4.2 kW and cost $3-524/kW. This translates to fuel consumption efficiency across all applications. Using the 3 kW fuel cell example- the system consumes 39 L/min Max H2 at full power. With the enhancement the system does the same work but only consumes 23.4 L/min (40% less). The goal of this project is to deliver a nanoparticle enhanced membrane to a commercial MEA partner for 3rd party evaluation as to the claims and merits of this breakthrough technology.

With companies getting more open up and passionate about introducing their new renewable technology to the public- it is not hard at all to have tours at companies with renewable energy highlights.Inspired by the NewCo event in the Bay Area- this ideais about organizing a NewEco Tour event- during which people can sign up for interesting companies' presentations and tours for free-have the flexibility to set their own schedule- and get valuable education about renewable energy and sustainable living. It will especially benefit communities who have renewable energy companies nearby. People will get more educated about renewable energy and feel more ready to start using it. Whatever idea you have- feel free to share! It will be great too if you can:1) name a few renewable technology companies in your community.And do you think these companies would like to give tours according to your perception of their public image? 2) tell us if you are interested in going- and what type of business/technology interest you the most.3) give your advice on how to efficiently organize the tours.

3Y40HMYLL1U1D4W2Y7FUBIG8SX6XUZ,3Y40HMYLL1U1D4W2Y7FUBIG8SX6XUZ, The basic premise is to have a label on food products (or any product) that quickly and simply shows to what extent everyone involved in making the product was paid a living wage. Like the organic labeling system- which allows consumers to make choices about how their food is raised- this label allows consumers to factor how well taken care of the workers are who make given a product into the consumer's decision before they buy.It also allows companies that take extra good care of their workers to charge a premium to consumers who are willing to pay for their good behavior. Naomi Klein in her book this changes everything writes that environmentalists need to consider the social justice picture when deciding what political battles to pick.e.g. rather than pursuing an umpopular carbon tax- we might want to put our energy into the $15/hour living wage campaign.This is because a living wage campaign would bring more people to the table to have the conversation about the environment- and also people who are not desperate are pickier about who they work for and what they allow their communities to go through.e.g. if a most people in a neighborhood are earning a living wage they're less likely to agree to the new coal plant or waste incinerator moving in.

3ZC62PVYDHMTU8QX3CQHVPFCMFNXXR,3ZC62PVYDHMTU8QX3CQHVPFCMFNXXR, There should be a community-based non-profit cooperative for putting rooftop solar on the homes of members. We've already seen how small towns in Germany can invest in renewables and be 100% energy independent while turning a profit. We've also seen how companies in the US can use leasing strategies to produce and install solar panels for no cost to the owner of the building and still turn a profit. Much like the creative leasing structure employed by companies such as SolarCity- the co-op would require members to pay a small monthly fee to participate. Much like the small towns in Germany- the profits would be shared among everyone in the co-op by distributing costs and re-investing to expand infrastructure to new members. Homeowners who want to base their energy on renewables- regardless of where they live- would want to participate in the rooftop solar co-op. Already there are for-profit companies offering leasing programs that make it affordable for homeowners and profitable for the companies that lease the solar panels. What's missing is a solar co-op that can offer similar services while building a strong community of people that benefit. The goal is to allow homeowners to pool their resources and move everyone toward a renewable future. The rooftop solar co-op offers the opportunity for members to become their own utility company while lowering their rates and possibly turning a small profit -- all while transitioning away from reliance on energy produced from less sustainable- polluting sources such as coal. By using an existing- proven business model and applying it to a non-profit- member-owned co-op- we can remove many of the barriers preventing homeowners from adopting rooftop solar for their homes. Traditional solar installations can be costly up front- even with subsidies. And installing the solar panels yourself means you are responsible for maintaining them. Solar leasing solves the problems of expensive installation and maintenance and replaces it with small monthly payments designed to be lower than your utility bill. Because solar leasing needs to be profitable- these companies will only install solar panels on homes with high utility bills and high rates.A co-op would remove profit-based financial motivations- and thus remove the financial limitations of rapidly expanding our solar infrastructure. Some co-op members will live in areas where their installation is more profitable than another. These more profitable installations can help subsidize installations in areas with lower profitability. In essence- everyone in the co-op will be able to subsidize and support each other. Because solar leasing companies are clearly able to be profitable- it is likely that a solar co-op would still be able to operate affordably even if the profitability requirement of a specific installation was relaxed to be more inclusive. The idea of sharing the benefits of renewable energy has already been proven effective by municipalities around the world and by solar leasing companies here in the US. Looking at the deregulated energy market in Texas would provide another example of how people can pool their resources to affect change.In Texas you can buy your energy from a broker who sources your energy for you. Mostly the energy brokers are competing on price but some of them are offering to source a high percentage of your energy from renewable sources. (http://www.txu.com/about/why-txu-energy/renewable-energy.aspx) Such a progressive organization will need some up-front investment to become effective -- possibly through donations or higher costs for early co-op members. Traditional leasing companies aren't normally profitable until a few years after installing the first solar panels. There would need to be partners that knew how to create a member-owned non-profit- and there would need to be partners for supplying and installing the solar cells.In order for this idea to succeed- the OpenIDEO community could help connect the legal- financial and leadership resources necessary to drive a community-centered business model.

3ZXNP4Z39RX4FZ3H7GJVQW71DDZ7LL,3ZXNP4Z39RX4FZ3H7GJVQW71DDZ7LL, Communities can make themselves independent by using their daily waste to produce energy.[UPDATE_FEB1ST] In Germany there is a community of 180 people nearby Berlin which are completely autarc from national power-plants. Read their story below![UPDATE_FEB9TH] Thanks to the great help of Emily from IDEO- who got inspired by the idea- we now have a beautiful visual to help understand the simplicity of the small homemade anaerobic digester (micro-biogas-plant) >> Check it out :-) This idea can benefit any kind of community that produces waste. The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached) It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner. People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached). We could organise building workshops- so that the people can see changes instantly.[UPDATE_FEB9TH] WORKSHOP_As it was of short notice - and we already took part in another workshop together with Otto Scharmer from Presencing institute MIT (which was great) in Berlin last Friday - we will have the workshop around the end of february. I will keep everybody involved updated on that - we will do it no matter how the idea proceeds now :-) It is amazing to see how many people are excited about this. FOR EXAMPLE_ I talked to a dear friend of mine during the Otto Scharmer workshop and we came up with an idea of combining the anaerobic digester and a filtersystem for water. He (the friend) has been in Bhutan- where pure water is a scarcity in some regions- due to lack of good canalization etc. So we are looking into possibilities of building a combination of both systems. The digester would be able to fuel the pumping-system and help the water to circulate more thoroughly. I am excited :-) [END OF UPDATE] Fueled by some great people here at openIDEO I am planning to pre-pone (?) the workshop on building gas-lamps out of plastic-bottles and do it in Munich or Berlin the following two weeks! Sounds fun? Get connected :-) I am certain- that many of you have been working voluntarily in one or another developmental surrounding in Vietnam- Pakistan- India or the African continent. There - in the rural area - this is quite a common form of producing energy for cooking and heating. So you have the knowledge or connections and could get these little DIY workshops started! Then- I believe- at some places the coin would drop and communities would look into that possibility of being autarc. Biofuels An Individual,0,3,1,3,4,0
