 Unpredictable changes in global climate- economies plagued by chronic instability and energy insecurity with volatile fossil fuel costs are all manifestations of the pervasive uncertainty that defines our time. This instability is symptomatic of the undermining of a worldview of constant growth and inexhaustible resources that disregards biophysical limits and our interdependence with natural systems.Communities can confront this uncertainty through:1) design that increases the capacities of a system to assimilate change rather than for a predicted set of conditions- and 2) integration of human and natural systems towards a co-evolutionary symbiosis that is able to perform within the biological and physical constraints of our planet.  This strategy/discussion would target planners- energy planners- urban designers on both the public and private sectors.  We keep constructing the built environment - from electrical outlets to nation-wide oil pipelines and massive hydro dams - on old ideas of how energy infrastructure should function. These old ideas are biased towardstop/down- single-function- non-renewable rigid infrastructure which need to change if we want to have any hope in the large-scale adoption of renewable and effective energy that needs to happen.  A collaborative analysis of existing infrastructure and its energy context of one city- from source to sink- to identify where there is opportunity for early intervention.  Expertise from those on-the-ground who have faced some of the challenges of operating within old infrastructure models. Also scholars who are working more closely with thermodynamics- exergy and related concepts as well as ecologists who are more knowledgeable of how energy is transfered through trophic levels in natural systems.

 In the more densely populated areas of a city there are generally large multi-residential buildings with occupants who already pay utilities. What if we had the option of paying a little more now as a group- so that everyone can benefit after the projects completion? Like crowdsourcing for renewables at the local and individual level.  The residents who help fund a project will benefit along with the building owners.  It's community specific- not nessesarily for every area or low density populations. Get enough people to chip in and those individuals will be rewarded and possibly those who didn't. It also takes some of the cost away from one individual and spreads it across many people to make it more affordable.  Community meetings to see who would be interested and how it benefits them.  Urban planners definitely- along with architects and community outreach programs.  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 The basic premise is to have a label on food products (or any product) that quickly and simply shows to what extent everyone involved in making the product was paid a living wage. Like the organic labeling system- which allows consumers to make choices about how their food is raised- this label allows consumers to factor how well taken care of the workers are who make given a product into the consumer's decision before they buy.It also allows companies that take extra good care of their workers to charge a premium to consumers who are willing to pay for their good behavior.  Naomi Klein in her book this changes everything writes that environmentalists need to consider the social justice picture when deciding what political battles to pick.e.g. rather than pursuing an umpopular carbon tax- we might want to put our energy into the $15/hour living wage campaign.This is because a living wage campaign would bring more people to the table to have the conversation about the environment- and also people who are not desperate are pickier about who they work for and what they allow their communities to go through.e.g. if a most people in a neighborhood are earning a living wage they're less likely to agree to the new coal plant or waste incinerator moving in.

 Impact investments are investments made into companies- organizations- and funds with the intention to generate a measurable- beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.Impact investingtrough your retirement schemeYour 401 k (or pension fund) had a policy to invest 5% on CleantechYou would get a report on the invested Companies.Your investor profile would still be conservative- still your expose to higher return (but also riskier) investments. 5% or less may be a small sum for you (but pension funds- have time - most investments need more than 5years - and need to diversify their expose).

 This idea is a mechanical system that collects rain water at a height and uses this to turn a dynamo and recharge large batteries as it comes down to ground level. Here it is emptied into storage tanks or wells for later use.The system provides free renewable energy and clean water to remote areas with high rainfall anywhere in the world.The key points are that: -it can be reasonably cheap to make and easy for local communities to construct themselves. - Useful in areas that are often cloudy and solar is not particularly effective - Each tower can generate enough electricity topower lighting at a recharge station and recharge radio equipment or mobile phones for locals.  The biggest places that will benefit are those in high rainfall/monsoon regions where a lot of rain can fall for many days. During the rainy season heavy cloud cover can mean very little sunlight for effective solar panel use. Areas that have no electricity supply at all will benefit the most.  We need to be able to use mathematical/physics models to see how much rain water needs to be collected to generate certain amounts of electricity. What size of trough is needed- how may towers are needed to have a constant supply of electricity while it rains?  A type of energy not listed  An Individual ,0,0
 We believe that everyone should have the ability to support clean energy.So we created a new way for people to take action.It's a pretty simple idea actually. We raise money through crowdfunding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations and worker-owned cooperatives.As these organizations pay us back- we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.It's a pay-it-forward model for community solar.We call it the Solar Seed Fund.Learn more at www.solarseedfund.org and www.re-volv.org!  The Solar Seed Fund benefits everyone by helping nonprofits and cooperatives that serve their community go solar. The avoided carbon emissions help alleviate climate change- and seeing solar panels on the rooftops of beloved community organizations inspires community members to go solar at home. But even if someone can't go solar at home- they can chip in and support the Solar Seed Fund and know that they are actively creating climate solutions. Every dollar donated is a vote for a clean energy future.Small community-based nonprofits and cooperatives often want to go solar to save money and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. However- due to their tax structure- credit rating- and the size of their projects- they often can’t find solar financing.RE-volv makes going solar easier for these organizations by offering low-cost financing through hassle-free lease agreements. In addition- through RE-volv's educational outreach programs- these community organizations are helping to raise awareness about solar energy among the people they serve.  RE-volv’s main objective is to implement renewable energy projects in communities that can’t afford them. Nonprofits and cooperatives that serve as the backbone of our communities are often left without financing options for solar energy. Through its revolving fund model- RE-volv is able to provide access to solar to those who previously didn’t have it.RE-volv’s programs are uniquely designed to increase civic participation. Traditional solar financing comes from a few big banks and financial institutions. RE-volv turns this model on its head.RE-volv gives every single person the ability to help support building local solar projects. This way- each person can take action on climate change and participate in creating a more sustainable community.Through this community participatory finance model- RE-volv creates localized- renewable power generation and green jobs through its solar installations.  So far- we've crowdfunded two projects successfully and are currently in the middle of our third crowdfunding campaign. You can check it out at www.solarseedfund.org! Lease payments from the first two projects have lowered the amount we need to crowdfund for our current project by $7-008. Soon we will launch our own crowdfunding platform giving donors the ability to view a portfolio of the projects they’ve supported and the environmental impact they’ve had. With the new platform we’ll be experimenting with functionality to find out what are the key features to foster engagement on the site.  We need to expand the Solar Seed Fund network and take our model to scale. We're going to be launching our own crowdfunding platform soon and we want to know from you- the community- how we can make this an interactive and empowering way for people to support clean energy. What can we incorporate to get people excited about supporting solar?  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 PEM fuel cells (PEMFC) and their hydrogen fuel requirement are struggling to compete with current energy options (gasoline- natural gas- hybrid electric). To overcome these competitors- reductions in the cost of manufacturing as well as improved efficiency and range of operating conditions need to be addressed. Hydrogen production costs and handling also will require reductions to the scale that petroleum refineries enjoy today. The Honda fuel cell FCX Clarity vehicle is rated at 59 mpg-e (mile per gallon equivalent to gasoline). If outfitted with the proposed enhanced fuel cell membranes the mileage would increase to 82.6 mpg-e.  A report by Transparency Market Research states the global fuel cells market was valued at US$355.3 million in 2011 and is projected to grow to US$910.3 million by 2018 led by the stationary segment expected to reach a market size of $4.17 billion by 2019.The initial target market is MEA manufacturers serving the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) segment- specifically those operating at low temperature in small stationary- transportation and portable applications. The market was selected because the technology has the greatest known impact on systems operating at low temperatures. Widespread use of PEMFC technology is due to low operating temperature- rapid start up capabilities- favorable power density/size ratio and the ability to vary output in matching power demand shifts also favored selection of this market.PEMFC is the most dominant form of fuel cell- accounting for over 40% of global installed capacity and close to 88% market share in 2013. Applications include forklifts- automobiles- telecommunications- data centers- primary and backup power systems.MEA manufacturers will be critical users of the process method integrated/outsourced with their existing or potential high throughput capabilities that would drive additional cost reduction requirements of supported catalyst manufacture. Target companies also harbor relationships with PEMFC manufacturers critical in understanding industry component development needs- providing performance validation and cost reductions facilitating widespread adaption of the product.  Customer interviews identified that catalysts have to be more resistant to CO- which the technology achieves by reducing the impact of CO introduced by the ambient air supply to the operating environment.The true value resides in increased power output capabilities. For example- a 3kW fuel cell system without the enhancement costs $14-800 or $4-933/kW. With the enhancement- the system output would increase to 4.2 kW and cost $3-524/kW. This translates to fuel consumption efficiency across all applications. Using the 3 kW fuel cell example- the system consumes 39 L/min Max H2 at full power. With the enhancement the system does the same work but only consumes 23.4 L/min (40% less).  The goal of this project is to deliver a nanoparticle enhanced membrane to a commercial MEA partner for 3rd party evaluation as to the claims and merits of this breakthrough technology.

 People need to know who (a face and name) they are paying energy bills to and who is tracking their energy expenditures for them to make more conscious energy related decisions. Our approach connects personalized energy experts who are workers at electricity grids or members of an organization such as LEED to families based on regions and socio-economic class. The expert could hold monthly meetings to provide information about energy and new low cost technologies that could help them save their energy consumption and identify a monthly target for each house. These experts would work closely with community leaders (if any) and create an energy council in the region that would be responsible for daily monitoring of payments.

 As we need to use what is already existing and keep it simple to allow community to quickly adopt renewable energy- we have to keep it simple and stupid. Otherwise it will take too long for the human to adapt. Thus I decided to use motion already existing- we will soon be 9 billion on earth and imagine if only 4.5 billions would wear my clothes. Your body motion is what will provide you your own energy. ,0,0
 A new pilot program will be tested in select suburban cities with current solar customers that allows them to come together as catalysts of change in the movement towards clean renewable energy. Current solar owners will be invited to an appreciation event in which they will be given greater insight into the vision of what a world with clean energy will look like. This event- co-hosted by non-profits and solar companies- will help each solar owner engage their close social networks to share this vision- opening with the simple question How can we better improve our neighborhood and invite their neighbors- friends- family and colleagues to a block party exploring their collection of ideas- with solar as one of the suggestions to explore.  The main players are suburban neighborhoods- solar companies and non-profits working to discover the needs of a community. Through this program- community stakeholders- like local businesses- city councils and schools- can be included overtime as ideas for neighborhood improvements arise from the opportunity events. For example- in my own community- a high concern is crime and a great solution that does not require added financial investment is engaging neighbors in starting a neighborhood watch. This has already happened in certain parts of our city- but is not universally practiced. Ironically- it is a simple invitation to an event and a willing host that sparks solution in communities and engages citizens into the development of a community. Going solar can become associated with a neighborhood that is well-connect and united in their values. Truly- while going solar initially has been a greatbenefit to individuals families- as the movement builds- it can be seen as an unexpected catalyst for change.  Their choice to going solar turns into them becoming invited into a greater movement- getting to know their neighbors- and gaining a new sense of purpose and hope for their community. This choice creates a greater push force in our communities to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. We no longer see it as a choice for us to make individually- but an opportunity for us to rediscover our shared challenges- opportunities and values.  As current solar employees and knowing several solar customers- we can enroll these customers into the idea and engage non-profits about the idea for the program. Finding a small suburban neighborhood with a high density of customers- at least 20 people who have gone solar-to pilot this program is possible. At first- the events will have to be provided by the employees and non-profit- but as long as we provide and track data about the rate of conversion to solar around the homes in the neighborhood- it could possibly start a pilot program that successfully creates the transition of solar systems to a retail product to an entry point towards a movement. This idea was sparked by a conversation among solar sales employees who want to try new ways in engaging the customer base and overcoming our greatest obstacles. This pilot program is meant to diversify the strategies and types of interactions that motivate people to going solar. California is at the forefront of solar with the recent announcement from Jerry Brown with the states commitment to 50% renewable energy generation by 2030. We envision this program to begin in the suburban areas of Los Angeles County- where cities are small in population and the population is highly diverse.  Collaboration from non-profits with presentations they already use to engage people about the positive vision of what renewable energy and solar can mean for our communities. Insight from current solar companies of the financial resources they can convert towards a pilot program or third-party non-profit that can test this idea. Contribution from the OpenIDEO community about how to collect and allocate the data collected by non-profits in the area interested in starting a program such as this and partnering with one- two or several solar companies.

 What would you do- if you could get all the energy that you could need in your life for just- one dollar? Besides stopping fossil and nuclear energy costs and pollution.There are such amazing and great projects- ideas and investigations about Renewable Infinite Energy production- besides the great ideas of all the people in here- that need to be known and supported to improve our world- so… “Lets make a viral commitment to support them”The main renewable energy generation methods to focus on-in my opinion must be the Electricity production from MAGNETISMandELECTROLYSIS PROCESSES to produce Hydrogen- Oxygen- and Electricity from water and air. Because this energy sources don’t depend on climatic circumstances- to produce energy.  Every community and every one shall benefit form renewable infinite energy- we all are the main players by doing a commitment to donate for support and by learning and teaching othersabout this kind of energy.  Via the viral commitment to spread knowledge and teach 10 different persons every week until every one on earth knows that everyone can produce and how to produce his own energy.  I can go out and start to speak to people about producing your own Renewable Infinite Energy and watch their reaction to the information- I’ll ask if they agree to the dollar donation as well. Every body wants to save money- don’t we? I have talk to a couple of persons and their reaction was positive. One of them even said- I wish you can make it come true.  I wish you could help me and the world to develop and administrate the donation system and project sponsoring methodology.  A type of energy not listed  An Individual ,0,0
 Transform the physical activity into electricity!Our idea is to use the force invested by the human body in moving heavy weights- walking- swinging and other activities- into energy.With the combination of discounts and gamification incentives- people from all ages would start to interact with the concept of being energy.MISSION & VISIONTo break the gap that exists between people and energy generation. Our vision is to shape the future into a community were through collaboration green and renewable energy can be produced- and that is perceive as a fun and healthy activity- either if you do it on a park- playground- gym or by installing a solar panel- contributing with energy generation would be the new Status Quo.  People from 10 to 70 years old that are able to do physical activities. Kids would interact with the POWERkids playgrounds- and would be motivated by the discounts and promotions they can get of app store of apple. This would help early generations in their transition to renewable energies by allowing them interact with games and the term of producing energy. Older users would share the need of becoming or being helthy- but would have the motivation of accesing to discounts and prices for ranking up. Another possitive impact would be changing the mind set of“investing energy in working out” to “giving energy while working out”.Another issue tackled by this idea is that the actual renewable sources such as sun and wind- are limited to the space condition- if there is not sun- no energy and the same with wind and water. This energy source comes from a resource that we have everywhere: people. A POWERLIFT could be open in an isolated village that doesn’t have wind- sun or water as an energy resource to power it up.  OpenCALI team thinks that the main reason for a slow transition from our current reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energies is that the actual options are not accessible and therefore there isn’t an interaction between the people and this technology.POWERLIFT erases this gap- allowing people to interact with a renewable energy technology- accelerating this transition and changing the actual status quo of “being fit” to “being energy”.  Until this point we haven’t done any test- we have done some research and know that the technology is being applied (links bellow) in other fields. At the moment we are working to calculate if it is possible to transform the gym into the electricity source of a neighborhood- how many people would be needed? How high would be the POWERLIFT daily goal? Etc.Jumping to prototyping with real people- we are thinking of testing the user experience in a local gym. Doing a wizard of oz prototype for the bracelet- where supposedly the harder you train the more energy you give to the gym- and therefor if your train hard enough- the gym is free. We would try to test this at the end of the upcoming week with a smartwatch- where a video would be played as if a battery was being charged over time.Another needed prototype- is the functional one. One of the OpenCALI member is an electronic engineer with experience on renewable energy- with him we would prototype a bench press that produces energy. (this is a more complex prototype- so it would take longer)Regarding the other exercises such as spinning- group classes and running in the treadmill there is actual studies and technologies to get energy from it- so there is not an immediate need to test it.

 During my research I had a hard time trying to find information and statistics about the household energy consumption in the US and other finance info about the monthly expenses.I had the idea of creating an information cluster down to individual data and how those information could be used to help communities lead the rapid transition to renewable energy.The Idea by itself help motivating and educating the consumer in different perspectives and areas- besides creating and revenue opportunity that could be used in rewards to the communities.  The idea would benefit several communities- and could be used in different groups- independent of age- sex or education.  The idea help the community increase they knowledge in they own habits and how they could save energy daily.

 STG International is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to the premise that innovative- affordable- renewable energy is the only solution to the growing tension between the aspirations of the developing world and concerns over global climate change. We transfer technology and build capacity by establishing local partnerships that manufacture- own and operate novel distributed renewable energy infrastructure to provide an affordable distributed utility service to rural areas. There are many companies that offer energy products to off-grid communities but we represent something different: a micro-utility- a full scale replacement for a 24/7 reliable electrical grid- specifically for areas that the conventional grid may never reach.  The lack of electricity infrastructure is especially apparent in rural communities. According to estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA)- only 14% of people living in rural Africa have access to electricity. This crucial infrastructure is needed by private households and it is essential as a multiplier for the effectiveness of institutions such as schools and health clinics that can otherwise only offer a bare minimum of services to their communities. Especially in regard to health institutions- the need for electricity is well understood: specialized medical diagnostic and treatment equipment (x-ray machines- blood analyzers- etc.)- computers- Electronic Medical Recordkeeping (EMR)- and telemedicine programs all depend on electricity. Supporting loads such as lighting (for increased hours of operation and security)- storage of medicines and vaccines- and the powering of staff quarters (which has implications for the attraction and retention of qualified professionals to work in remote areas)- are also basic requirements for effective health care.In addition to electricity- thermal energy plays a vital role for operations and hygiene in the form of cooling or heating the clinic facility and the providing of hot water – an aspect often overlooked in electrification programs. Common sense indicates that clinics and schools cannot operate effectively if the temperature rises above 90°F or drops below 50 °F- but little is currently done to systematically manage climate extremes when planning infrastructure upgrades.Based on published data- STG estimates that there are 80-000 health clinics and 260-000 schools worldwide that currently operate without electricity. The total value of this market is US $4.5B. To put the global market size in context- in Africa alone the market for diesel generators has been consistently growing at 30% per annum since 2006 and exceeded US $1 billion in 2007. This figure of course belies the real cost of diesel power generation- since the annual cost of fuel consumed by the installed base of generators is an order of magnitude greater than the annual capital investment- with estimates ranging between US$10-50 billion.  Most off-grid communities in developing countries are dependent on kerosene lamps for lighting as well as batteries and diesel generators for powering basic appliances. The lack of proper access to energy sources forces communities to pay very high prices for electricity use despite the fact that most of these villages lie in areas with ideal resources for implementing affordable solar energy systems. STG’s approach is to help communities to bridge the gap between the feasibility of using renewable energy systems and the high capital cost that prevents their implementation with specialized off-grid technology and an innovative partnership model.Additionally- one of our core beliefs is that sustainability can only be secured in the long-term if the communities actively participate in the electrification process. Next to technology transfer and training of local employees- it is of great importance to us to not deliver our energy systems as a black box- but to invite members of the community to learn about the technology and to incorporate their suggestions into our design process at an early stage.  STG International was founded on the basis of our experiences as volunteers in Lesotho- Africa. Throughout our work- we were able to gain extensive knowledge of the needs of underserved communities and therefore identified the lack of access to electricity as one of the main obstacles that stands in the way of delivering adequate education and healthcare as well as the building of infrastructure needed for economic development. After founding STG and designing our technology- we installed our first energy system at Matjoto health clinic in Lesotho. Over the course of this process- we established a local subsidiary- STG Lesotho- with several full-time employees- and cooperated with the Lesotho government to offer training and educational courses to students and the local population. The first installation of our energy system enabled us to gain valuable experiences on how to optimize our business plan and our technology. Based on these experiences- we feel confident to move to the next step and install our first- village-scale pilot systems to test and further advance our approach and our energy systems.  One of the main reasons why we would like to become a member of OpenIDEO is its focus on community. Throughout our work in developing countries- we have seen that many projects are well-intended- but fail to succeed because the local population is not included in the process of finding and designing solutions to their pressing problems.STG’s approach is to put the community first and ask the local population about which services they need and how these services should be structured. Therefore- we look forward to sharing our approach with the OpenIDEO community and look forward to any suggestions- ideas or recommendations on how we can improve our technology and our interaction with communities.

 Imagine if we in the Bay Area could generate more renewable energy than we use- sequester more carbon than we emit- and use only the water we have locally- all by the year 2050? Sustainable Silicon Valley believes that with Silicon Valley’s ingenuity and collaboration- we can accelerate climate action that envisions a Net Positive future for the region. Using SSV’s existing partnership group that includes corporate- university- municipal- and NGOs throughout the Bay region- SSV will initiate projects in low income areas- galvanize Net Positive projects- and celebrate other good works throughout the Bay Area that progress towards a Net Positive future- beginning with a multi-cultural- low-income community in East Palo Alto.  Net Positive is designed as a program and vision for the entire Bay Area- and the pioneering neighborhood is going to be in East Palo Alto. East Palo Alto is a multi-cultural- low-income neighborhood in the heart of Silicon Valley- covering a 2.6 square mile land area in San Mateo County and has a population of 29-000. As of the 2010 U.S. Census- the median age of East Palo Alto’s resident population was 28.8 years and its racial composition was 64% Hispanic/Latino- 16% Black- 11% Asian/Pacific Islander- 6% White and 2% Other. EPA’s population is noticeably younger- on average- than San Mateo County’s population and proportionally far more ethnically diverse. Why East Palo Alto? The Bay has many affluent communities that have well developed and well defined and reasonably well funded Climate Action Plans.Some less affluent cities and neighborhoods are at risk of being left behind but face the same- if not more- risks and challenges with changing climate.Further- as the tech revolution runs the risk of increasing the gaps between the haves and have nots we fear a similar gap will develop in the emerging solutions and associated economy of climate technology and adaptation.We as a region and as a connected world cannot leave entire communities out of climate change solutions.Therefore SSV and East Palo Alto are working cooperatively towards funding and executing projects in neighborhoods within the city that drive it towards a Net Positive future. Success in East Palo Alto is not only good for the City and its residents but can be repeated in other disadvantaged communities. With this in mind SSV and East Palo Alto has developed a mutually beneficial working relationship. East Palo Alto is intent on being an environmentally progressive community. This is reflected in their general plan and in their budget. Many funded and unfunded city projects move East Palo Alto towards a Net Positive future. Both the City and SSV hope now to leverage the Net Positive Program and its Climate Equity fund to both progress unfunded projects and start new projects that continue this ethic. East Palo Alto has limited financial resources but there are many things in its favor- which point to success. East Palo Alto has a committed and engaged city government- has many non-profit and community groups working hard for a better community- has been effective at raising money through grants- is identified as a CalEPA enviroscreen disadvantaged community that may get additional State resources- and it resides in the middle of one of the richest most technologically and intellectually vibrant areas in the world. This project and its outcomes are achievable because all the individual pieces are already in place. Stakeholders such as PG&E- the water district- the city- local businesses- and SSV have the mandate- the will- and the expertise to carry this project forward. The key is to utilize SSV’s community relations experience- its volunteer group- and its collaboration skill set to organize and coordinate the various groups towards success.(Update 1/28) East Palo Alto shares many of the same attributes and stakeholders as other low income neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area and the Nation. By proving this concept in East Palo Alto a template for success will be built for other low income communities. SSV looks to expand from a small pilot of 650 home across the rest of the city- to other communities throughout the Bay- and beyond.  In the case of East Palo Alto- this pilot program fits with the City’s Environmental Action Plan and the City’s General Development Plan. It will provide a roadmap for how to take specific actions across the rest of the City. Further- a disadvantaged city such as East Palo Alto does not have the financial resources to meet the state’s energy- carbon- and water reduction goals. By demonstrating a program that raises capital funds for improvements- leverages existing resources to communicate and implement a plan- and measures the outcome represents a novel jump in the way we approach low-income neighborhoods on the issue of climate action. The Net Positive East Palo Alto initiative will have a huge and positive impact on the community both to local businesses- local tradespeople- landlords and renters- with the overall benefit of a positive environmental impact.●Low-income homeowners and specifically renters will benefit from lower expenses of energy utility bills. Agreements will be put in place to ensure tenants receive savings where landlords pay utility bills. This will have a consistent economic and emotional benefit to families.●Local businesses where appliances are purchased- such as Home Depot and Ikea- will receive an economic benefit due to increased sales- stock needs and installation as the program begins purchasing water and energy efficient appliances. The local community benefits as increased staff needs are required.●The water programs reduce the existing load on the extraction of well water. The State of California has issued water reduction requirements and this project helps the water district meet these needs●The City of East Palo Alto will reach goals set out in both their general plan and Vista 2035 goals.  Update 1/28/15: The initial project is to do outreach in a particular neighborhood to make sure that residents are aware of and can take advantage of special programs from PG&E and others to lower their utility costs.PG&E offers free appliances- efficient light bulbs and other things that can dramatically reduce energy and water costs for low income households. It can be hard to access these programs- so SSV’s outreach approach- in partnership with other local NGOsand students will help boost access from 1.1% to 20% or more of eligible households.Building Net Positive communities is a long-term strategy and goal. Working in cooperation with city governments and local stakeholders- SSV will ensure that projects are undertaken with the local communities’ support. SSV has already engaged city leaders and the community in East Palo Alto to ascertain support for the program. The projects that are being identified for East Palo Alto are in collaboration with the city leaders and stakeholders and will be backed by surveys and audits before implementation.  As we move towards refining and developing our program- we would love to get feedback such as insights into implementing systemic change in a multi-cultural- multi-lingual- low-income community.

 In the Kafue Plains of Zambia- where fishing is the predominant means of generating income- fishing communities need an efficient way to keep their catch cold until its sold.Ice blocks are currently the most common method of preserving and storing fish- but this method is inefficient and impractical. In response to this problem- Kafue resident Mr. Robert Shimaingo- has designed and developed an underwater- dam-free turbine that that will harness energy from the flowing river to power a cold storage unit for the fishermen in the region to preserve and store their fish. The turbine harnesses natural energy that is abundant and accessible through most of Zambia.  As many as half of local residents of Kafue earn their living from fishing but prices must be slashed when the fish cannot be kept cold. The power generated by Robert's turbine is intended for a refrigeration system that will enable fish caught locally to be stored and sold at the best price.  Currently- people in the Kafue region use ice blocks that are frozen in other regions and transported to the rivers to store fish. This has proven to be inefficient and results in many of the fish becoming rotten. Through this technology- they will be able to minimize food waste with reliable electricity that is cleanly produced.  Robert Shimaingo has already started testing a prototype in the region.However- the prototype still needs to be improved to reach the necessary power requirements. Drawings and technical specifications are also a future challenge.  - How to improve the prototype - How to connect Robert Shimaingo with other people interested in the technology - Other communities that could benefit from this technology - How to scale the technology  A type of energy not listed  An Individual ,0,0
 Everyday users of fossil fuels- including electricity- natural gas- heating- and gasoline- on a high level knows that they are:1) Causing health problems to themselves2) Damaging our Earth3) Attributing to natural disastersThe harsh reality is that if someone does not care about saving the environment- their mindsets are hard to change (unless something happens to them- which would then be too late!) .  That being just one example- it is important that it becomes a group effort with corporations that are involved with sustainability to educate and appeal to their clients the correct way.

 The REISAP (Renewable Energy Information System Analysis Portal) Idea- has been developed from insights gained through my research phase of the How might communities lead the rapid transition to renewable energy?  project.A primilary depiction of this idea consists of 4 parts: -A web portal-A smartphone application-A specialized computer measuring/input device-An integrated community portal section and electrical micro-grid/distributed storage and renewable energy generation system  This system is focused on users in low-density and rural areas where the local/regional utility is experience diminishing returns on their investment in providing energy to users (i.e. for every dollar the utility invests in energy product- they experience a negative return which increases with distance)The main players are the users- the portal operators and company- the microgrid operators- the suppliers and installers of energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and financing organizations.  (Repeated from above)The idea addresses four issues or pain-points- identified in my previous post- “The Complexity (Paralysis) involved in the Transition to Renewable Energy”:-Decision analysis and comparison of current and future technologies-Being able to select feasible and practical energy consumption reduction methods- to reduce the size and cost of the installed renewable energy system-Being able to analyze and selecting between different system options (investing for water heating only first- then build on the system) paths based on least cost- investing in part now and the rest later- and available financing-Being able to apply what if scenarios- based on usage and environmental factors  An early- lightweight experiment that I can you try out in my own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations- is to choose a:1. (option A)suburban home and apply a simplified version of the idea to a home in the suburban area 2. (option B) location in a rural area with basic energy needs  The skills- input or guidance I would be keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to collaborate with and help you build out or refine this idea further are:A.

 Empower Generation empowers women to deliver clean energy to communities. We identify- train and support women as entrepreneurs to sell portable solar PV lighting and mobile charging solutions to their last mile customers in Nepal.The widespread use of cell-phones in developing countries willenable us to reach distant markets and electrify one third of the world's population living in energy poverty.  Nepal’s entire population is under electrified- with 60% percent not even connected to the unreliable electric grid. Empower Generation serves rural households that typically spend around 10% of their income on harmful and ineffective lighting- like kerosene lanterns. Rural women bear the brunt of energy poverty in Nepal- as they are responsible for obtaining basic fuels and providing energy services to the family. With limited or no career options- women are often confined to these traditional tasks. Empower Generation offers women life-changing careers providing vital energy services to local communities. Empower Generation is a lean- global team that works with local stakeholders to catalyze energy access. Our local women-entrepreneurs are the main players. We also work closely with local community organizations and financial institutions- mobile money service providers- and solar power system designers and manufacturers.  Solar power is available- affordable and reliable – the obstacles lie in financing and distribution for under-electrified rural communities. Our model empowers local women to become a part of our solar distribution franchise and sustainably deliver power to the last mile. With the convenience of mobile payments paired with mobile-controlled systems- EG entrepreneurs can offer customers high-quality- efficient solar power systems for their homes in exchange for monthly payments. With mobile money- entrepreneurs and agents will be able to collect monthly payments easily even when customers are hard-to-reach.  We are ready to pilot our PAYG solar-home-system and mobile payment platform within our existing distribution network of 7 women-led solar businesses and expand it to our 2015 class of 10 entrepreneurs later this year. With an expanded customer base- more enterprises and a mobile marketing campaign EG will be able to build on our existing model of women-led distributed energy services to offer more customers more power and appliances with built-in financing.  •Mobile money + telecommunications partners/advisors•App/backend software developers/advisors•Consumer electronics specialists to help us integrate PAYG technology- solar power components and appliances into a compelling package •PAYG technology sourcing partners•Training programs for solar installation/maintenance partners/advisors •Customer Financing/Impact investment/Program-Related-Investment  Solar  A Group Brainstorm ,0,0
 The Solar Bud Lamp is a prototype for a series of household products that are powered by sunshine. They are intended to provide exposure to practical solar power applications on a personal level.  Initially- the Solar Bud Lamp is suited to DIY 3D printers. But in a wider sphere it- and similar products- may be attractive to anyone who enjoys capturing and managing their own energy. It providesvaluable lessons in the usefulness of sunshine- thefinite quantity of energy available for use- the value of energy conservation- and our relationship to the natural world.  The Solar Bud Lamp is a household object that can introduce the basic nature of solar power to the community.  A protoype of the Solar Bud Lamp has been 3D printed and is being tested in operation. The files for 3D printing the Solar Bud Lamp will be posted on a well-known 3D printing service site and will be available to the public for download.  Electrical engineering.

 Smart City Africa Project is a comprehensive energy efficient project that is beneficial to people from all ages and classes. its benefits impacts from the slum residents to the high placed society individuals.Smart City Africa Project- just as the name suggests is a city project which comprises of residential- commercial- Industrial- social- educational- health- security- energy- technology and utility projects all in one city. It is a city that will be completely free from any form of fossil fuel for its power usage thereby making it a renewable energy powered city. The appealing nature of the project will create a huge demand for more of this city projects in more locations inAfrica and even the world at large.  Smart City Africa Project is beneficial to African residents and visitors from all works of life- all ages- and the location choice will focus on rural areas which are abundant in unused land areas thereby depopulating the popular cities and building new and smart cities from the revenues and products of the Pioneer smart city.Because of the comprehensive nature of the city- It will impact lives in so many waysthereby creating a smart living culture among residents of the smart city.I see a sustainable future and a city like this would be a big step to creating that sustainable future-so far I have thought of several ways to create this future- well I came up with an Idea . since it takes a huge fund to make this project a reality- I thought of drawing up a 3D design of this plan and marketing it like an off plan project which will come with a price as well as incentives. Although my target might not be the low class population but I thought of the idea of selling citizenship's to this city with a starting price of $5000 individuals to $20000 for families and at this price citizens can benefit from free health care- a housing unit and security as well as business opportunities in the city. this can be achieved because Africans yearn to live in a better environment and for that price the middle class can really benefit from this- and since the first phase of this city is to set up energy efficient production lines which would be used in construction of the city- the low class can also benefit by having massive job creations.  As a Smart City Project- powered by renewable energy- also a production hub for manufacturing of energy efficient products- which will be used to build more smart cities across Africa- the transition will be an unconscious and automatic one. As the demand for more smart cities will increase- especially due to the affordability of energy efficient living. I would like to add some further Statistics- the most populated city in Africa Lagos is approximately 1000km2 with a population of about 20 million people and the reason for the huge population because of the amount of production going on in the city. so if a new and smart city with 3 times the land mass and over 500 energy efficient production lines and over 1000 services and small companies and businesses- there will be a huge significance in the major cities depopulation as citizens will begin to seek employment in the new city and the Smart City Africa project is looking to be home to 5 million citizens.  A plan is all it takes. if a plan of this city is designed and awareness is being created for the Smart City Africa Project- it will attract governments- investors- banks- communities- individuals and many more fund sources to partake in the project. choosing a location for a pioneer smart city in Africa- Nigeria by population is the largest populated country in Africa with major cities like Lagos- Abuja and Port Harcourt. But the smart city best location would be the less populated locations that are close to the major cities such as Imo state- Akwa Ibom state- Cross river state etc..  The skills required for the Smart City Africa Project idea are as many as one can imagine Architects/ designers-Engineers-Technology experts-Accountants-urban city planners-renewable energy experts- and many more experts.

 Imagine you wanted to make the shift to an alternative energy source- how would you do it? Consumers- financiers- and technical providers will be able to directly connect through our online social marketplace: closing the access gap to renewable energy. Whether the consumer is an individual- a school- or neighborhood- they can find the resources and options they need: banks to finance a program- a government grant for their project- or the technical experts to make it happen.Local options will be showcased- allowing each community to build and tailor their options organically.Consumers- financiers- and technical providers can post a call for proposals for a specific project or just start a conversation with potential partners.  This benefits the current and future players in the renewable energy marketplace. The way that Craigslist or eBay facilitated connections to happen by providing an online platform- we are adding an additional layer of communication to make getting renewable energy easier.Interested teachers can see the options available to their school- whether with energy providers or potential financiers. Homeowners that don't have the funds to install renewable energy can find a grant focused on this switch in their area and the company to make the switch. Addressing all needs in one marketplace - the demand- the supply- and the money - we give people the space to proactively seek solutions tailored to their needs.  Currently the available marketplaces are geared towards individual homeowners with the capital to finance such changes. This online network makes the entire idea of switching to renewable energy more accessible for a variety of different organizations and groups.This easy access- and partnerships built between technical providers and financiers- will allow the idea of switching to renewable energy easier.  We would first test the concept on a very small and localized scale. Using a lean start-up methodology of 'concierge service' where we will provide our service to a very small number of people- learn from this- iterate- and organically grow. To start- we would find 5 different types of consumers. Working exclusively with those groups/individuals- we would help them identify their best renewable energy options. Then we would reach out to current providers (and funders depending on the need) and facilitate that connection. From learning about this type of interaction with the customers- funders- and providers- we would then do a second iteration of this. During this time- we would also build a minimum viable product of a marketplace and start using this to facilitate those connections. This approach would allow us to learn and pivot accordingly.  We would love to hear about:- attempts to do similar partnerships- including any models to specifically show - any alternative models or financing options to complete renewable energy projects. - examples of this in other sectors - specific groups/individuals/businesseswith whom that we could test this idea out- general feedback to build on this idea- different ways to test this  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An OpenIDEO Meetup ,0,0
 A beautiful tree that generates wind energy used for public needs: street lighting- charge phones- provide wifi and music.A self-sustaining energy source for community building.  The Wind Tree is ideal for developed urban settings. An ideal community for these trees could be Chicago - a city that combines affordability with desirability. Having wind- budget and taste for art- the city of Chicago is a great place to ‘plant’ these trees.However- we should not limit to windy cities- since these trees can work with very soft breezes (4mph). Considering that 88% of the US consumers prefer to use renewable electricity- these trees can work in basically any urban setting.People could use these trees for their community activities- taking advantage of the energy generated. Another key players are Universities. Students can gather around these Trees to study and do their activities.  This Tree is the first real possibility to generate wind energy within a city on a large scale. By surpassing the three previously mentioned barriers- it helps communities rapidly transition to renewables.The more Giving Trees we ‘plant’ the more green energy will grow- replacing fossil fuels consumption. Having them on public spaces will also generate awareness of this issue.  The original Wind Tree has been prototyped three times in France and during the upcoming months will launch to the market at a price of €29-500. Prototyping the Giving Tree as a whole won’t be cheap nor lightweight. But we could apply a more user-centered approach- checking out how people react to the aesthetics and uses of this tree- even though it’s not actually generating energy. After talking and surveying my classmates at Chicago Booth- I found out that not many would walk into the park just to sit next to this tree... but if the tree was located next to the (football) field then it would be really useful- both for them and for the people watching  What other community activities could be done around these trees? This idea has been growing faster after different brainstorming sessions we had with Natalie (see attached pic)- if anyone is interested in joining the next session just let us know!

 Our idea is a solar pay-as-you-go “business in a box” kit for Tanzania. It is an income-producing asset for an entrepreneur (just like a chicken or goat) but it is also an affordable way to buy light (and mobile phone charging) for an end-consumer. The kit consists of 2 “hockey puck” rechargeable lights/phone chargers and 1 solar panel as well as instructional information and marketing materials. We call it the “hockey puck” because it looks like a hockey puck (we’re Canadian) and contains a rechargeable battery- LED- USB phone charger. We will sell this kit to entrepreneurs who then earn income from selling recharges and an end-user now has access to clean- affordable light and energy. It's a win win.  Social: Lack of light at night restricts children’s study hours. Toxic fumes cause death. KARIBU offers children the opportunity to study at night- the family to charge their mobile phone- and eliminates toxic kerosene fumes.Environmental: The use of kerosene emits millions of tons of CO2 / year and every KARIBU solar lamp sold reduces CO2 emissions by an estimated 100kg / year.Economic: Families waste 90+ USD every year on fuel and lack of light restricts local entrepreneurs. KARIBU saves money and increases working hours for small businesses.With KARIBU- families can afford solar lighting/mobile phone charging with the benefits above. For small shops- they now have a profitable business and no longer spend money on kerosene – sunshine is free. Furthermore- money stays in the community (that formerly went to buy kerosene) and it spurs local economic development.  Solar in Africa comes with a significant up ­front cost- which is not affordable for rural populations (and it's hard to get it to them). Our approach aligns the cash flow for solar lighting and mobile phone charging with that of kerosene–making it affordable. We leverage the existing sales channel for end­-users like Alice (the small shop network) and sell them a “businesses in a box” which allows them to become profitable in a few months.In contrast to the traditional manufacturer → retailer → customer model- KARIBU provides a continuous income stream (and more jobs) for entrepreneurs vs. a one-­off sale. This approach is very conducive to rural communities that are far from towns or the electric grid and that have no mobile network reception (and it doesn't have to be constructed/nailed to a roof). Given the relatively low up ­front cost for small shops- and short payback period- the model is very scalable.  We are in the early stages of launching these new kits. We ran a small pilot project in Moshi- Kilimanjaro with great success. Here are some videos with one of the entrepreneurs- Good Hope:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L_Ln96e0iY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWWA1CriF0k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIo-OaNlyAU  We are looking for help in making the product very high quality and also cost effective.

 As a Materials engineer- I've always been fascinated on how playing with materials and discovering new ways to use them can be a revelation and change the world with them (Eg: Silicium revolution- Eg. Maybe Graphene? ). But there are MANY other examples. Window glasses that change their optical properties depending on the temperature- so to be extremely energy efficient.Conductive Inks that can just be printed- saving millions of chips waste.Adaptable airplane wings (profiting from Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) properties) that would mimic birds flight to be totally aerodinamic.And the list continues.So my idea is also focusing in the way materials themselves can contribute to the better profit of energy.  People who like research and experimenting. Anyone can- but mostly engineers and chemists.  Renewable energy is not just focused in producing energy- but profiting it the best way possible.

 Having access to electricity shouldn't be the only objective but it should be well utilized to gain the most out of it and create a sea of possibilities.Community owned micro-hydro plants are widespread in parts of Nepal.However- they are often tremendously under-utilized- and the electricity generated is used only for modest lighting of homes and charging mobile phones.This is not the best use of scarce capital resources.  Microgrids are usually located at regions where the national grid cannot connect under cost effective conditions. Without access to electricity- day to day activities are difficult. Such communities are the victims of poor quality living trying to adapt with the unavailability of critical resources due to its geographical location or being isolated from urban areas.Such was the condition at Barpak- Gorkha until they had access to electricity due to which anchor loads could also depend on along with the use in households and productive end uses. However- it was not just the access to electricity but the technique for its efficient consumption that accelerated their rate of development drastically.  There are communities in Nepal which lack the availability of electric energy and communities where micro grids are already established and yet they rely on the use of coal and other natural resources. Our scheme encourages efficient consumption- rapid development and replaces the need of consuming natural resources.The existing micro grids or national grids that supply energy to communities don’t have such schemes with demand side management i.e structuring the load by charging different tariff rates for various time of consumption. So why not establish a structure of consumption if it makes a system more reliable and productive.  A proof of this scheme already exists in a community called Barpak located in Gorkha district in Nepal. It provides an output of 130 kW to the community consisting of approximately thousand households. The attractive part is that this scheme provides an uninterruptible supply of electricity at a cheaper rate than what is provided by the government. However- the main point is that the community experienced rapid development after availability of facilities like bakery- mills- cable television- metal workshops and internet.Our vision is to replicate this proof in other communities through collaborations and implementation.  Any form of input is welcome. It may be ideas that provide incentives for communities to implement this scheme or replacing an asset that they need daily by another that consumes renewable energy instead due to which they might prefer the consumption of renewable energy and even any commentsregarding the post.

 Communities can make themselves independent by using their daily waste to produce energy.[UPDATE_FEB1ST] In Germany there is a community of 180 people nearby Berlin which are completely autarc from national power-plants. Read their story below![UPDATE_FEB9TH] Thanks to the great help of Emily from IDEO- who got inspired by the idea- we now have a beautiful visual to help understand the simplicity of the small homemade anaerobic digester (micro-biogas-plant) >> Check it out :-)  This idea can benefit any kind of community that produces waste. The size of the bio-gas plant is dependent on the kind of waste- which can be used. for example- for a whole village you would need one- which can make use of a mixture of gases from plants as well as from lifestock or humans.The whole benefit is- that the community would have a closed circle of ecology and would be autarc/mostly autarc from capital-driven national organisations.It is also sometimes the only alternative for very rural areas in development countries to get energy and heat (see the video attached)  It creates a stronger sense of community by itself already- because everyone shares the communities energy and benefits directly.People will have the experience that they are not dependent on unknown corporations anymore- but have it at their own hands. You will be much more energy conscious- because you will be able to relate much better- if the plant itself is around the corner.  People can build a mini bio-gas plant by themselves (see picture attached). We could organise building workshops- so that the people can see changes instantly.[UPDATE_FEB9TH] WORKSHOP_As it was of short notice - and we already took part in another workshop together with Otto Scharmer from Presencing institute MIT (which was great) in Berlin last Friday - we will have the workshop around the end of february. I will keep everybody involved updated on that - we will do it no matter how the idea proceeds now :-) It is amazing to see how many people are excited about this. FOR EXAMPLE_ I talked to a dear friend of mine during the Otto Scharmer workshop and we came up with an idea of combining the anaerobic digester and a filtersystem for water. He (the friend) has been in Bhutan- where pure water is a scarcity in some regions- due to lack of good canalization etc. So we are looking into possibilities of building a combination of both systems. The digester would be able to fuel the pumping-system and help the water to circulate more thoroughly. I am excited :-) [END OF UPDATE]  Fueled by some great people here at openIDEO I am planning to pre-pone (?) the workshop on building gas-lamps out of plastic-bottles and do it in Munich or Berlin the following two weeks! Sounds fun? Get connected :-) I am certain- that many of you have been working voluntarily in one or another developmental surrounding in Vietnam- Pakistan- India or the African continent. There - in the rural area - this is quite a common form of producing energy for cooking and heating. So you have the knowledge or connections and could get these little DIY workshops started! Then- I believe- at some places the coin would drop and communities would look into that possibility of being autarc.  Biofuels  An Individual ,0,0

 Create a website that tests the energy efficiency of consumer products- sells the best of them- rejects those that don't meet the standards and educates consumers about which is best to buy in terms of energy usage.  This benefits consumers looking for energy related information for the products they're buying and the manufacturersof energy efficient products. This would focus on targeting educated consumers in developed countries first. The site would gain traction by first finding groups that are already advocates with money to spend a little extra on energy efficient products. Then it would rely on educating additional- more mainstream consumers to continue growing.Manufacturer's will also want to cooperate by providing the information about the energy used to produce or dispose of the products to gain access to the marketplace. If they truly have made improvements- they will want to show the proof of that.  It allows for energy efficiency to be a main consideration when buying new products. We can be sure that millions of people will continue to buy tons of stuff years into the future. We can also be sure that businesses will continue to sell millions of products too. It will be easier to slightly adjust that behavior than to make large changes to it. If consumers demand more energy efficient products- then businesses will clamor over themselves to meet that demand- profitably. That will help reduce the energy demand world-wide- and allow renewable energy sources to provide a larger percentage of energy.  Go out into stores where people buy these products and talk to them. Watch them as they decide which appliance to purchase. Start with people who care about the issue and then broaden to the main-stream. Show them mockups and prototypes in the store of sample energy scores for the products they're considering and explore whether that affects their decision of which to buy. Experiment with educating consumers about specific aspects of the issue and then exploring whether that affects their purchase decision. Talk to manufactures and explore how likely they would be to make changes to their products knowing that there is a growing consumer demand for those changes.  What can manufactures do to make products more energy efficient? What types of products can we include in this? How to we evolve this from being focused just on reducing energy use to producing products that create renewable energy?  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 Do you think nuclear power is bad- likenuclear bombs?Opposition to nuclear power is a legacy of the 70's anti-war movements.Now we know that the threat from climate change is far worse than the risks from existing nuclear power plants. Deaths from coal mining and power plants far- far outnumber all nuclear power-related deaths.Yet archaic fact myths fuel opposition to nuclear power- which currently provides 65% of our clean energy.Nuclear is needed to address climate change in the time frame and at the scale we need.We need to remember who the real enemy is (fossil fuels and carbon emissions) and allow nuclear energy to be on the team that is working to save the planet. We may even like 4th generation new nukes!  This idea benefits everyone because it hurts fossil fuels.Individuals and community leaders should demand that local and national environment groups accept nuclear as a part of the necessary transition to clean energy as a solution to climate change.Listen to the many experts who support nuclear and stop trying to close nuclear power plants. Instead demand more accountability from federal regulators and regional power industry professionals.Evaluate new nuclear technologies and learn the real facts : don't allow myths to make you harbor unrealistic fear of something that you have a near zero risk of injury from.Work together to support smart nuclear policies to help diminish the economic and political power of hostile fossil fuel interests- who are successfully buying our elections and holding our politicians hostage.With every nuclear power plant that staying in operation- re-opens or is built- we keep oil and gas from replacing that energy and force oil and gas to keep those fossil fuels in the ground- where they are needed.By the way- here is a list (created by the Breakthrough Institute plus some) of people who already support the need for more nuclear power.President Barack Obama-Ansel Adams-Paul Allen-Steward Brand-Sir Richard Branson- The Breakthrough Institute-Carol Browner-Dr. Stephen Chu-Gwyneth Cravens-The Dalai Lama-Jared Diamond-Senator Al Franken-Bill Gates-Dr. James Hansen-John Holdren-Dr. James Lovelock-Dr. Jane Long-Mark Lynas-George Monbiot-Hugh Montefiore-Richard Rhodes-Jeffrey Sachs-Stephen Tindale-. . . and many more  This idea empowers communities to aggressively seek renewable energy while also having as back-up a clean energy source that reliability backs up their renewable power.Currently our major source of reliableback-up power is coal and gas.Dependable energy storage is still a long ways off. Nuclear power can be designed to supplant fossil fuels now but to operate at reduced levels when not needed to support community energy needs.Nuclear makes full-implementation of renewable power feasible- since all renewable power is still intermitten in nature and is not enough by itself- such as when it rains- at night- when there is no wind- and when there is peak demand- etc. without the need to resort to burning coal.NUCLEAR POWER IS BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE THAN COAL AND WE NEED TO ALLOW IT TO CO-EXIST UNTIL WE CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING OUT SUFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY.  I am looking to organize a summit of environmental leaders and pro-nuclear leaderswho recognize that fossil fuels are the real enemy in our climate-threatened world.I would like this summit to air legitimate grievances with nuclear power and address realistic solutions that could enable nuclear power to regain acceptance by environmental groups as well as the broader general public.This summit should present credible experts and allow for real debate by participants.Let's be sure that we have left no stone unturned (or feasible technology unexplored) in our search for rapid solutions to our climate crisis.It would be my hope that this summit could result in a statement of acceptance of a nuclear roadmap by the collective group prior to the Paris COP- that could help provide meaningful solutions for countries seeking to make ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon emissions by 2020 and onward.  I am calling this the Silver Bullet Summit and I need help getting financial and organizational support for this summit from foundations and non-profits and determining the key environmental leaders and experts to bring together for this life and planet-saving summit to be held in the late fall of 2015.I am at an early stage of conceptual development- and starting to prepare materials for it but I would love to have more people interested in working on this with me to make it happen.

 AVAVA Systems mission is to design the most compelling and sustainable solutions for affordable housing in the world. We believe renewable energy should be fully integrated into to our living and working spaces as a standard option. This combined with a high efficiency building envelopes and natural water treatment systems will allow people to build new towns and cities nearly anywhere in the worldin a way that is truly sustainable. Our designs are intended to be locally manufactured and assembled in order to create jobs for these communities.For the people- by the people!  Our product is intended for a number of communities- these are as follows:The 863 million people across the world are living in slum conditions. (As of 2015). The 42 million people left homeless because of natural disasters. (2010 Figure). The 27 percent of Americans that spend more than half their income on rent. (As of 2010) The 3 billion people- or about 40 per cent of the world’s population- that will need proper housing and access to basic infrastructure by 2030- according to UN HabitatOur population is expanding at an exponential rate and the only way to achieve an acceptable standard of living for the people of this planet is through innovation. We implore you to help us with this mission.  If renewable energy comes standard on any living or working space we build- than the need to “transition” becomes unnecessary. In addition- if these spaces are so elegant and desirable that all the surrounding communities decide they simply must have them- than you start a renewable energy movement by demand. This is a very important factor. The majority of people didn't crave electric automobiles until Tesla started making them desirable. We must combine the form of beautifully designed housing with the function on renewable energy in order to create a scaleable solution that will go viral.  Avava systems has approached the owners of a few vacant lots around the San Francisco Bay area and has received permission to do a pilot projects at these locations. This would allow us to test an initial production run of our units as well as get feedback from local users. We are also in conversation with a architecture firm that is working on sustainable work force housing for a number of projects throughout North America.  The folks at AVAVA Systems love meeting anyone who is passionate about affordable- sustainable housing. With that said- we are especially interested meeting people are working on real development projects and are open to innovative methods. We are also currently in fund raising mode- so if you or someone you know is interested in investing in “the most compelling way to build our communities” we would love to talk to them. Finally- we are always interested in talking to mechanical engineers and industrial designers.(UPDATE) One of the best things about contributing to this challenge has been the talented people that have come forward to offer their time and expertise to help us be more successful. 1. Thank you so much to Matthew Chow from the IDEO team for the help he gave us regarding our business strategy. Matthew started with a great template to evaluate our product applications. He then helped us figure out a clear and concise business plan around that application including potential partnerships- value proposition and growth strategy. Matthew's energy was inspiring and he asked some really good questions. We really appreciate the time and effort he devoted to our company.2. We have been contacted by mechanical engineer who shares our vision for creating affordable- sustainable and sexy housing solutions. We look forward to collaborating with her. We have also been contacted by a designer who is focusing on better utilizingpublic and vacant spaces- and we hope to provide him with some innovative solutions. A big thank you to OpenIDEO for getting our idea in front of people in a way that inspires them. We look forward to strengthening these relationships and building more as we move forward.

 Kyrgyzstan has a considerable rural poor population and an ongoing energy crisis.Many of these rural communities have livestock- making them perfect candidates for biogas digesters as a source of cheap- renewable power- with the added benefit of manure as a by-product. However- there is as yet little understanding or trust in biogas as an energy source. This idea inspired communities to use biogas by providing a live and trusted demonstration of how it works. Harnessing children's natural 'pester power' and funding a pilot community will spread the power of poo to Kyrgyzstan's rural poor and enable them to lead their country's renewables transition.  This benefits rural poor communities with livestock in Kyrgyzstan- one of DFID’s 28 priority countries. These communities live predominantly off their farming practices and have little or no access to energy. Kyrgyzstan has a high rate of literacy and we would expect the education of the target communities to be basic but with reading and writing competency. Rather than specify locations at this stage- it would be preferable to work with already established local NGOs to ensure the right pilot community is chosen- and help to build bridges to other communities.Specifically targeting the poorest families and women to become the community-employed plant maintenance operatives would help to address the additional needs of these groupings.  These communities do not currently use renewable energy sources as uptake in Kyrgyzstan of biogas has been very limited- despite its perfect positioning for this fuel type due to its combination of livestock and an energy crisis. This is largely due to prohibitive costs and lack of understanding in communities which this idea seeks to overcome. By using the positive influencing of children and broadening this out to the whole grouping- the pilot community will recognise livestock excrement as a source of power and a solution to their energy needs.  Running a workshop with children- and a second with children and parents- to test educational methods and the power of infant influencing- will help to understand the best methods of approaching this educational phase and ascertain what branding territories might be most applicable.

 Besides going to a lovely eco-house- where else can we go for an eco-tour? How about Tesla and SolarCity? With companies getting more open up and passionate about introducing their new renewable technology to the public- it is not hard at all to have tours at companies with renewable energy highlights.Inspired by the NewCo event in the Bay Area- this ideais about organizing a NewEco Tour event- during which people can sign up for interesting companies' presentations and tours for free-have the flexibility to set their own schedule- and get valuable education about renewable energy and sustainable living.  It will especially benefit communities who have renewable energy companies nearby.  People will get more educated about renewable energy and feel more ready to start using it.  Whatever idea you have- feel free to share! It will be great too if you can:1) name a few renewable technology companies in your community.And do you think these companies would like to give tours according to your perception of their public image? 2) tell us if you are interested in going- and what type of business/technology interest you the most.3) give your advice on how to efficiently organize the tours.

 To bring citizens--US & worldwide--into the conversion to renewable energy process- we need Small Vertical Solar Units. (Think of them as sort of like R2-D2s- but different.) These units could be mass produced- & purchased & installed in backyards & on building tops everywhere. Their solar cells would go up vertically- not horizontally- and work all day long--if designed to follow the sun--to produce a small-but-significant percentage of the electricity needs of- especially- households. Since they could be purchased & installed at relatively small cost- additional units could be purchased--or rented--& installed almost without limit- until- theoretically- allhousehold--& EV automobile--electricity needs are met. Heights would vary.  This idea benefits citizens everywhere- in an immediate- financial sense; but also it would benefit citizens everywhere in that it would greatly reduce the burning of coal and other fossil fuels for electrical power.  It would make small- vertical solar units affordable to everyday citizens. Anyone with a small space open to the sun would be able immediately to cut down on the electric bill- and help battle climate change.  Probably none. We live in an apartment in the city- and I do not have a shop for experimentation.  I would like to be included in the think tank for developing the idea- as I have certain designs in mind and just love the idea- but I am not concerned with idea proprietorship or other personal gain. SVSUs need to be invented and produced- if we are going to stop catastrophic climate change.  Solar  An Individual ,0,0

 The suggested model creates an opportunity for individuals and communities to earn money- gives flexibility to the consumers to buy only as much energy as he might require and ensures availability of energy for everybody all the time.To execute the model- the owners of residential houses and commercial buildings install a device (eg: Solar panels) to generate the renewable energy. Their respective energy needs are satisfied by the energy generated by this device and the unused energy is sold to the power distributors. Anybody who is in need of energy can buy it from power distributors. Public transportation- small and large scale industries are some example organizations who might want to buy energy from the power distributors.  The idea benefits all stakeholders. Main Players: 1)Residential communities: Anybody irrespective of income- education- sex- age can invest in the renewable energy generating device and participate in the process 2)Commercial buildings: Buildings like government office- private office- shopping malls etc can invest in the device that generates energy from renewable resource and participate in the process 3)Government: The government body must play a regulatory role in the process 4)Power distributors: Government can create a division which acts like a power distributor.  Experiments can be carried out to verify the following assumptions: 1)People are willing to contribute to the mission ‘green earth’. 2)Technology can be twisted or re-engineered to accommodate the changes made in the process.First experiment can be carried out to verify the technical capability of the devices and setup. This can be done by making prototypes with the help of electrical engineers.Once the first experiment is successful- second experiment can be carried out in a small town with a reasonable number of people. Ideally the town should have both residential and commercial communities.  I would like to hear from OpenIdeo as to how best they can help me with this Idea.But if OpenIdeo needs me to define my expectations- here are some ways OpenIdeo could help me. - Feedback- comments and improvement suggestions from experts always help. It will be extremely helpful if experts from OpenIdeo help me refine the design. - Could OpenIdeo help me identify the authorities who can make the required changes in the system?

 There should be a community-based non-profit cooperative for putting rooftop solar on the homes of members. We've already seen how small towns in Germany can invest in renewables and be 100% energy independent while turning a profit. We've also seen how companies in the US can use leasing strategies to produce and install solar panels for no cost to the owner of the building and still turn a profit. Much like the creative leasing structure employed by companies such as SolarCity- the co-op would require members to pay a small monthly fee to participate. Much like the small towns in Germany- the profits would be shared among everyone in the co-op by distributing costs and re-investing to expand infrastructure to new members.  Homeowners who want to base their energy on renewables- regardless of where they live- would want to participate in the rooftop solar co-op. Already there are for-profit companies offering leasing programs that make it affordable for homeowners and profitable for the companies that lease the solar panels. What's missing is a solar co-op that can offer similar services while building a strong community of people that benefit. The goal is to allow homeowners to pool their resources and move everyone toward a renewable future. The rooftop solar co-op offers the opportunity for members to become their own utility company while lowering their rates and possibly turning a small profit -- all while transitioning away from reliance on energy produced from less sustainable- polluting sources such as coal.  By using an existing- proven business model and applying it to a non-profit- member-owned co-op- we can remove many of the barriers preventing homeowners from adopting rooftop solar for their homes. Traditional solar installations can be costly up front- even with subsidies. And installing the solar panels yourself means you are responsible for maintaining them. Solar leasing solves the problems of expensive installation and maintenance and replaces it with small monthly payments designed to be lower than your utility bill. Because solar leasing needs to be profitable- these companies will only install solar panels on homes with high utility bills and high rates.A co-op would remove profit-based financial motivations- and thus remove the financial limitations of rapidly expanding our solar infrastructure. Some co-op members will live in areas where their installation is more profitable than another. These more profitable installations can help subsidize installations in areas with lower profitability. In essence- everyone in the co-op will be able to subsidize and support each other. Because solar leasing companies are clearly able to be profitable- it is likely that a solar co-op would still be able to operate affordably even if the profitability requirement of a specific installation was relaxed to be more inclusive.  The idea of sharing the benefits of renewable energy has already been proven effective by municipalities around the world and by solar leasing companies here in the US. Looking at the deregulated energy market in Texas would provide another example of how people can pool their resources to affect change.In Texas you can buy your energy from a broker who sources your energy for you. Mostly the energy brokers are competing on price but some of them are offering to source a high percentage of your energy from renewable sources. (http://www.txu.com/about/why-txu-energy/renewable-energy.aspx)  Such a progressive organization will need some up-front investment to become effective -- possibly through donations or higher costs for early co-op members. Traditional leasing companies aren't normally profitable until a few years after installing the first solar panels. There would need to be partners that knew how to create a member-owned non-profit- and there would need to be partners for supplying and installing the solar cells.In order for this idea to succeed- the OpenIDEO community could help connect the legal- financial and leadership resources necessary to drive a community-centered business model.

 No matter where you live- electric power is needed when an emergency happens. Power is essential for emergency response operations involving communications- fire and police stations- command and control centers- hospitals- water and sewer plants- water pumping- elevators- fuel pumps- medical equipment- refrigeration- heating- and for so many other types critical- electronic equipment. Solar plus energy storage for critical community facilities—fire- police- emergency shelters- as well as power protection for affordable and elderly housing facilities—is the technology innovation with the greatest potential to expand community-based renewable power to scale across the US in the years ahead.  All members of a community can benefit from distributed- resilient power solutions like solar+storage located at critical facilities and community shelters. Other who could benefit are vulnerable populations including the disabled- elderly and the poor- if resilient power solutions are incorporated into their buildings and facilities. If these facilities remain “powered” during a long duration power outage- residents will not have to be moved- their ability to charge medical and mobility devices will remain- refrigeration and heating systems will be powered- and they could ride out the outage by sheltering in place. As communities start to prepare of the effects of climate change and energy assurance- the ability to deploy clean- reliable- renewable energy solutions should be at the top of the list. How and where solar+storage technologies can keep emergency management and response systems powered should be incorporated into new community planning discussions and resilience plans.In a blueprint for how a community could become more “power resilient-” Clean Energy Group produced a report- Clean Energy for Resilient Communities- which shows how the City of Baltimore and other cities could use clean energy to create a more reliable electric system that protects vulnerable citizens during power blackouts. The report is the first in-depth review of national policies and finance strategies to use solar and energy storage to provide more power protection in an urban setting. The report says that critical public facilities like hospitals- fire stations- gas stations- community shelters- and schools should use more resilient power technologies to protect people during power outages. The report also recommends new business models and highlights the emergence of companies that now sell solar with battery storage services to customers—to address the overlooked problem of stand-alone PV systems not working during power outages. See http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/2014-Files/Clean-Energy-for-Resilient-Communities-Report-Feb2014.pdf.In order for this transition to succeed- community leaders need more information about how these technologies will work and how they can finance them. Developers need to understand how to incorporate these technologies into their plans and how to communicate the benefits to communities. As communities- such as those in Massachusetts- start to deploy solar+storage technologies- Clean Energy Group needs to work find out what challenges they faced- how they overcame those challenges- and then provide these lessons-learned to other communities who are moving in the same direction.  Installations of solar+storage technologies can accelerate renewable energy markets. If more communities install solar+storage technologies in place of diesel generators- more resilient- clean and reliable power will be provided during power outages. If these systems are sized to provide power to larger loads all of the time- communities will decrease their reliance on fossil fuels and drive the market demand for solar and storage technologies. This increased demand should result in lower costs as these markets achieve scale. The more renewable energy technologies are deployed- the greater our ability to meet the challenges of climate change. As a society- the move the domestic- distributed energy production in renewable energy will also have economic- health- and other societal benefits at the local and national level. What many people who install gird-connected solar PV equipment on their homes fail to realize is that in most cases- if the grid goes down- there solar panels can no longer supply electricity to their homes. With solar+storage systems- additional equipment is deployed that would allow the home to disconnect from the grid during a power outage and continue to generate power that the homeowner can use. The same goes for business and other facilities. Adding storage to a system moves the solar equipment to a new level – with the ability to provide power during an outage.With steadily dropping costs in both solar and energy storage technologies- solar+storage has become a viable and more reliable choice for emergency power. Not only do solar+storage systems have the ability to provide power indefinitely when the grid is unavailable- they can also cut costs and generate revenue during the 99.9% of the time when the grid is functioning normally. In many cases- these savings and revenue streams can drastically reduce the payback period of an energy storage system. These technologies can provide clean energy- possible revenues- and more energy security to communities. As part of the Resilient Power Project- Clean Energy Group has created a small technical assistance fund to help communities analyze these options as part of our Resilient Power Project- with funding from several foundations. But the demand is great to work with more communities across the country. In addition- to get to scale- new forms of financing mechanisms are needed to aggregate projects and bring in lower cost capital to reduce project costs for communities. Our Resilient Power Project is addressing the challenges to widespread deployment of these technologies. We have recently published a report- “Financing for Resilient Power Solutions” that can be downloaded at http://www.cleanegroup.org/assets/Uploads/CEG-Financing-for-Resilient-Power.pdf. Solar+storage is a hybrid innovation that benefits customers directly- so it is not dependent solely on the environmental attributes of the technology- but rather follows the “disruptive technology” path of cheaper- smaller and more effective technologies that will upset the established grid status quo more rapidly than a pure subsidy based model.  Clean Energy Group is working with leading community developers to install these technologies now in affordable housing communities across the country. We have a special interest in multifamily housing for low income and elderly residents- as well as assisted living and supportive housing and community facilities.We are beginning to see multifamily projects develop clean distributed generation combined with storage (resilient power) to protect low-income and vulnerable populations from extreme weather-related power outages that can last for weeks at a time.We are not a developer or finance institution. But we work with those entities- and we provide technical services and possible funding for predevelopment costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects. In addition to providing support to developers of affordable multifamily housing and community facilities- we are working with local agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in low income communities throughout extended power disruptions.Clean Energy Group is also working to create a network of state and municipal officials across the country to address climate adaptation and resilience. We are partnering with state agencies and finance intermediaries who are concerned that critical services and facilities remain up and running in communities throughout extended power disruptions.We and our partners can help state energy assurance planners to craft policy through our information sharing- best practices and research- and by sharing our experience and contacts. Clean Energy Group can also provides technical services and some funding for pre-development costs associated with near-term clean energy storage projects.  We would love working with the OpenIDEO community on clean energy deployment and an information sharing platform to distribute our free reports- concept notes- webinars and newsletters on resilient power to those who would be interested in that information.

I have nothing to gain!”The renter says: “I’m not going to pay tens of thousands of dollars to improve someone else’s property!”We need a solution to this problem.We need to require that leases have these kinds of profit sharing clauses for both renters and landlords.Or- create incentives for renters and landlords to sign leases like this.

 Younger people often convince their parents to go green because of their strong concern about climate change.What if we incentivized this by offering scholarships or forgiving student loans?e.g. If a family with a kid installs solar on their roof- the kid gets $2000 scholarship fund.If the family buys a an electric vehicle or a plug in hybrid- the young person gets another $2000.This could add up quickly as kids realize there's money to be had in getting their parents to do the right thing.Parents could also decide to go green because they love their kids and the incentives help them out.It could lead to a lot of change fast.Let's harness the younger generation's environmental energy to change their parent's actions now!  This could benefit families with kids. Younger folks get help with paying for college.Older folks get renewable energy and a lower carbon footprint.Everybody benefits if more families go green.  It helps create a tipping point to engage kids in working on greening the world and fighting climate change while receiving an incentive that will directly help them.Younger people want climate action anyway.If you pay them to work on it- they'll work that much harder.Also parents (usually) trust and love their kids.For the parents- kids are a trusted messenger- so the kid has a pretty good chance of convincing their parents to make the change- especially if the kid explains that the change will help them lead a better quality of life when they are their parents age.This whole idea could work for grandchildren and grandparents too.  Do a test where a foundation or private donor puts the word out there in a certain community that it will pay millennials whose parents go green- and see if the rate of going green goes up or not.  I'd like to connect with a funder who is willing to fund a study to see if the idea works.We could start with LED lightbulbs in a certain city or neighborhood.If kids convince their parents to switch to LED's- the kid get's a scholarship- or money for books etc. I'm a media maker who is already connected with a think tank of environmentalists based in SF.

 There is a significant need to create a renewal energy community within the low income community for various reasons. Adapting to the split incentive between building owner and building renter – it is important to increase awareness of renewable energy amongst the renter community so that they can take advantage of the financial and environmental benefits.

 If we are to reach our carbon neutral goals- the development of Palo Alto’s EcoDistricts will be the tool by which we facilitate community-level engagement in sustainability initiatives-identify existing community resources and opportunities; leverage these assets and opportunities; and through behavior-change science mobilize our residents.Eco-Districts will provide the format by which the city acts as a laboratory for sustainable technologies- policies- and planning.  There are people in each neighborhood of our community who are ready to step-up and lead others into amore sustainable lifestyle.Through the formation of Ecodistricts and this process of engagement The City can empower these individuals to do just that.The best part of this approach is that it allows each neighborhood (and block even) to decide what they want to focus on- whether it's shared solar purchasing- energy efficiency competitions- or planting an edible garden- the important thing is that the citizens who want to be engaged have a process- a pathway to ease implementation and a partnership from their City government.  Our community is unique in that it owns its' own utility which already provides 100% carbon neutral electricity.This is to say that we are now turning the focus towards the elimination of natural gas in our community.This will require more fuel switching or switching over to renewable electricity.In order to effectively meet the goal of a carbon neutral city- we need the participation of everyone in our city.We need renewable energy- energy efficiency and carbon neutrality to be integrated into the running of each household and business here.The setting up Eco-Districts allows us to rapidly transition to meeting our bold goals because it is a process that engages EVERYONE block by block.Block Leaders will be empowered with tools to lead their neighborhood into a carbon neutral future.  A first step would be to mock up a sustainable neighborhood toolkit for our city (many cities have them... see the City of St. Lois or the City of Toronto for some good examples.)With that in hand- we could begin to explore how one of our civic leaders or self-chosen block captains would like to begin engaging with their neighbors.Theprocess of engagement can be a collaborative- emergent process that fits the leadership style of the individual.Once the mock-up tool kit and engagement process is vetted by our top community leader(s)- we could begin by doing a pilot ofONE block or a slightly larger pilot could be to focus on the downtown as the first Ecodistrict.

 A multi-platform display and communication system that creates a far greater level of transparency around energy usage. It allows users to- at a glance- see a live reading of your usage by converting your kilowatts to currency; compare usage with similar households (based on individual user profiles- linked to social media etc); and allows for deeper insights into possible energy savings with alternative providers/sources (based on neighbour usage).  It is designed to be used across the whole community- irrespective of social-economic status- including education and financial situation. By designing an app that can be used on a smartphone- computer or smart TV- we are able to cover large sections of the community. We are seeking to capitalise on the abundance of data available already from our smart meters to better inform the consumer about making renewable energy choices.Open source development would be an ideal way to roll out a testing stage of this app.  The Power Portal empowers the consumer through transparency and knowledge about there energy usage by promoting an organic switch to renewable sources.In turn- this creates a groundswell of community understanding and agency- which can be used to put pressure on big business. After all- if there is enough demand- the bigger power businesses will feel the pressure to stay relevant to there market. This will drive a rapid change in delivering renewable power to your doorstep.  Stage 1 By gaining access to the Smart meter we can quickly and easily see users consumption instantly.

 WrightGrid is developing solar powered charging stations that can help rural communities in the developing world gain access to electricity and lead the transition to renewable energy. In today’s world of mobile technology and rechargeable batteries- people don’t necessarily need electricity delivered to their home - they need a battery charged. By providing lockers at a station- members of the community can drop off their device (or battery) for charging- and feel confident that their property will be secure and charged reliably. A simple- modular- central charging station- simplifies logistics and maintenance and lowers the cost of delivering renewable energy.  This idea benefits people and communities in the developing world that do not have reliable access to electricity. Most of whom have cell phones. One quarter of the world’s population is still without electricity- yet according to a recent U.N. report- 6 billion out of 7 billion people on earth have mobile phones. Cell phones can greatly improve quality of life in a rural village by providing access to medical care and financial services- improving community safety- and enabling local business and commerce.Each station or network of stations will need to be operated by a local organization or individual.  These stations provide an alternative to running diesel generators to charge batteries- and will reduce pressure to extend the grid from centralized fossil fuel plants. Just as the developing world leapfrogged land-based telephone lines to mobile technology- so too will it leap over the model of a centralized power grid for delivering electricity. As the developed world is looking to smart grids- micro-grids and energy storage to increase resiliency of the power grid and enable greater penetration of renewable energy- this same technology will be leveraged to more quickly and affordably electrify rural developing markets. Our stations will help pave the way for larger renewable power stations- that will likely be based on similar technology and concept- to provide a wider range of services to heavier loads- perhaps even electric vehicles- or to power loads in homes and community centers.  WrightGrid is currently deploying our stations at schools and Universities across the US- as well as taking them to outdoor music festivals and other outdoor events to engage the public- develop our technology and better understand how people interface with the stations and what the expectations are. The response to our charging stations has been overwhelmingly positive thus far in the domestic market. People need and want continual use of their cell phone and are less concerned with how this is enabled. So the real value of energy is the service it provides to the end user.  We would love to hear insights from the folks at Ideo.org and others with experience working in the developing world about the best ways to deploy our station and build a local presence. I’m sure there are conditions ‘on the ground’ that we haven’t anticipated that will influence our design and business strategy. We are hoping to connect with folks who can work with us to design the human interface to be more intuitive and accessible for people who speak other languages or cannot read. We would love to hear ideas about the possibilities of connecting our stations with mobile applications and services. We need to identify strong partners and we also need to continue to work on developing models for funding the stations and generating revenues.There are many other considerations- design options- ideas- statistics and data we can share to help facilitate the conversation- but had to omit for the sake of brevity. And while we could spend a lot of time talking about our ideas so far- we really want to hear YOUR ideas! ,0,0
 If we can measure our energy consumption easily we can start to change behavior. This would be a product people can buy with the goal of doing your part to make the world a better place. Track how your specific lifestyle changes are making improvements. Compete with your friends. Earn status among friends who care about this issue. Earn badges that encourage sharing your progress and status- thus spreading the movement. The software would make recommendations on how more lifestyle/behavior changes could help you improve. Additionally- the software will make recommendations on low energy products that will help the biggest energy hogs in your home and estimate how much those products will help your eco-energy score.

 The idea is to give rewards to individuals and organisations in the form of:1.Annual Awards for those who have helped to reduce- generate and store renewable energy the most within that year.2.Project Funding for the few top winners who would like to develop their project further.3.Incentives based on the amount of energy they have saved- generated or stored for others.  The idea can benefit any community- around the world. The focus is to connect individuals and small organisation to help each other in collaborating to create sustainable environments beyond their owns.GIVING BACK program includes everybody with different motivations in creating sustainable environments. The environment savvy- the people and communities and small organisations who need to create their legacy- the entrepreneurs- designers and any individuals who would like to get simple payments from their efforts. We can also involve big corporations in: 1.CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) departments to sponsor this initiative 2.Companies who produce green technology to sponsor a community to start this program.  GIVING BACK program provides opportunities for everybody to start their own renewable energy initiatives and extend their individual efforts to others and rewarded for it.  The implementation could be started within a small community of approximately 50 participating households from different backgrounds and few community buildings such as schools- clinics and markets.  To build this idea further- I would love the OpenIdeo community to help giving ideas and to develop developing the tools (smart-energy meter and the applications tied to it) and ideas or any suggestions on how to transfer stored energy in a simplest way possible.

 Imagine a world where energy is generated and transmitted by solar panels that are embedded onto existing roadways.This concept builds upon existent solar roadway projects and involves development of solar roads that power non essential power needs for small to medium sized gated communities- industrial parks- hotel resorts..etcThis involves construction of a mini grid fed by roadways or bike ways that can tap solar energy and transmit them within a gated community .Since the roads are always exposed to sunlight and road construction is a basic infrastructure requirement- this appears to be a win-win strategy to bring in infrastructure development to new community developments in environmentally conscious societies.  Targets affluent communities that seek to live in energy efficient housing projects and builds awareness that subsequently passes onto other communities. This could be implemented in projects being undertaken in an energy conscious community for e.g.: part of construction of hotel resort in Dubai. Main players include end customer- real estate developer- project contractor and local energy utility company.  Implementation of a project such as this increases technical and financing knowledge on implementation requirements and can be replicated elsewhere. Solar Roads has tremendous potential to power self sustaining communities that are far flung from normal grid supply as well as benefit communities that wish to be more energy efficient.

 Our idea is a milk pasteurization productthat tackles the problem of climate change by producing needed product (safe milk) alongside renewable energy production.Our team of Stanford electrical engineering PhDs have invented a new- low-cost- super low energy method for pasteurizing milk. It uses high voltage pulses to directly kill bacteria rather than heating the whole volume of milk up- cutting energy use by 50%. Where there is milk- there is cow poop. The poop from a single cow can pasteurize 10X the milk it produces- and cuts methaneemissions frommanure. Our units can eliminate the 50% of milk spoilage in Africa (boosting income)- empower local food-sheds- save lives- and cut the 4% global CO2 & CH4 from farms & industry alike.  Small farmers in emerging markets with high spoilage rates - We are looking at India and Africa where spoilage rates are 30-50%- reducing the income of people on a key stepping stone out of poverty. These households typically have 1-5 cows and need a highly affordable system that is financed so they don't have to pay the whole amount upfront. Pasteurizing it before someone comes to pick milk up on a bicycle means it doesn't spoil and they get paid the full amount. Every time the pasteurize using our cow-poop powered system- they prevent methane emissions and make more money.Industrial milk producers - Most milk is processed at large processing plants which are huge energy hogs. We can put in our lower-cost systems at these industrial plants- and cut energy consumption by 50%.Artisinal cheesemakers - Cheesemakers often spend as long pasteurizing as making cheese- and they hate it! We can do it faster- which means they can make more cheese. More cheese = more happy cheese eaters! It also means more money in their bank. Farms pasteurizing milk for their calves to drink - Calves are typically separated from their moms at 1-3 days on larger dairy farms. The USDA has found that a lot of calves get sick from unpasteurized milk- but many farmers can't afford a $10-$50k pasteurization machine. Save calves through affordable milk pasteurization.Others - We are also looking at raw milk- home cheesemakers- and others.  By embedding renewables within the dairy system- we change the renewables challenge and value proposition by making it one component of an income-generating product. Users can produce more electricity than they need- so they can also retail electricity to neighbors and others.  We have talked to farmers in Costa Rica- China- and the US and we think there is a real need for our product. We do not yet have FDA approval for our new technology and one question we are trying to answer is if people in under-regulated markets will accept our technology (eg. small rural farmers in emerging economies- aged cheesemakers- raw milk drinkers- others) before we go through this long process. For the US- we are testing this now. We need to ask the same of people in emerging markets.  Help us design a product that fits into the way that people make milk and manage manure now.Also- help us get perspective on our ideas about emerging market opportunities- spoilage- and on-farm milk pasteurization. Though we are close to markets in California- we don't have as much perspective on emerging markets.  Biofuels  A Student Collaboration ,0,0
 How about we capture and utilize the kinetic energy (KE) we generate through locomotion. We can capture this energy and convert it to potential or electrical energy using a portable and wearable device (yet to be designed or developed). This can then be used to charge devices on the move.  This idea can benefit both developing economies where there are many communities without sufficient supply of energy. In these communities- also- there is lots of human movement in the form of trekking running- farming- sports and so on. If this KE is harnessed- it will go a long way in cushioning the hardship of insufficient energy supply. This is also beneficial in developing worlds- where people mostly live a sedentary life. Overall- the3 areas of potential value creation of this idea are: (I)Energy Efficiency-(II) Health (keep fit! - you’re encouraged to move thus- jilt a sedentary lifestyle)(III) and of course- charging on the move (convenient!). The age groups this solution caters to cuts across all demographic and there is no limits to the education level either.  Based on initial research- 30 minutes of human activity (running- gyming- jogging etc) can potentially generate up to 300watts in power if fully harnessed. This is enough energy to charge an average cell phone for 15 days (assuming the phone is charged to full capacity once a day) or an average laptop for 5 days (also- assuming the laptop is charged to full capacity once a day). These figures- are of course- estimates but they show at a high level- the enormous potential of energy that can be generated by harvesting our KE.  Conduct a simple survey within the IE community and Madrid to ascertain if people would love to not worry about chargers- sockets- plugs etc when it comes to charging their devices.  The success of this idea depends on the portability of this energy converter/storage device (simply a battery). It has to be simple- light-weight and easy to use because the customer will wear it as he/she moves about. As mentioned earlier- this device has not been designed nor developed- but- I strongly believe it is possible. I need people with technical science/engineering skills to evaluate the feasibility of creating such a device and advise accordingly- bearing in mind the criteria outlined above.

 The Union of Concerned Scientists says that biodiesel made from waste materials or used cooking oil can cut global warming pollution by 80 to 90 percent relative to conventional diesel fuel. This idea builds on the simple idea of producing biodiesel with used cooking oil at the local level- in developing economies by removing a common barrier to setting up small biodiesel plants: training and technology acquisition needed to empower local production. Using a simple training (academy) model- this scheme will produce wide benefits to local entrepreneurs- ecosystems- and to participating businesses.  There are many different community members that benefit from this idea: - Local food producers: From restaurant owners- to operators of small food stands- anyone with used cooking oil on their hands can now see additional income on a regular business by becoming part of the feedstock bank for the local plant. - Local entrepreneurs: Setting up a biodiesel factory can provide long-term- sustainable income in any area with a thriving commercial sector (hotels- restaurants- etc.) This business can also provide green jobs to several employees. - Vehicle owners: Biodiesel is an affordable- clean alternative to conventional diesel. It helps vehicles run smoother and leads to engines lasting much longer. Further- owners won't be subject to the price volatility of fossil fuels. - Community members: Everyone in the community will enjoy the longterm health benefits that come with increasing renewable fuels in the area- less asthma- less polluted waters- less lung disease. And- in the long term- a thriving ecosystem and environment. In many developing nations- citizens rely on generators as a vital power source- using biodiesel instead of traditional diesel can produce powerful environmental benefits.  Once a plant is set up with equipment and some initial feedstock (used cooking oil)- the timeline to produce an initial batch of biodiesel is very short (a few days).From here- the work is to secure and widen a customer base by spreading the word and educating the community on the benefits of switching to biodiesel. This idea is simple- biodiesel plants will become valuable environmental education centers for the community- which is just as important as their production capacity. By providing an alternate- clean fuel source- these plants can encourage a swift transition to renewable fuels from polluting ones for anyone that owns a vehicle or generator.  At this point- I need to better understand the costs associated with setting up a small biodiesel plant- including the price of necessary machinery- and the steps needed to ship it to various regions around the world. To do this- I can start reaching out to some equipment producers to obtain price quotes and information on shipping. [Update: added interview!]Additionally- I need to better understand what type of organizational model would work best here (nonprofit/social enterprise).  - What are some ideas for how I can make this business model lean? The goal is to make this service as affordable as possible for local entrepreneurs interested in setting up and owning plants. - Are there business models out there that I should look to for inspiration- including outside of the renewable energy sector?- Does anyone have information biodiesel equipment pricing- or can you recommend good companies that I should look into?

 While many cities and companies are looking for ways to become more environmentally friendly- most are limiting their efforts to simply reducing consumption.NetPlus envisions a movement- powered by public-private partnerships and systems building- that inspires individuals- communities- and businesses into net producers of energy.This is accomplished by a combination of implementing best practices for reducing the need for energy consumption- while focussing on the opportunities for energy generation.  Mostly school communities in urban/rural areas. The main players are the school administration- teachers- parents- students- local power company and local government.  Benefits concentric communities centered around schools. Changing the way children interact and learn about renewable energy- making it an inherent part of their everyday life- will also lead to educating their parents and in turn theentire community around them.  DIY projects in the classroom: building your own solar backpack- creating soccer balls and footballs that create energy- plans for farmers markets and community vegetable garden that can be used for school lunchesBring in different members of the community to speak to children about their own experiences and open their eyes to the world of sustainability outside the classroom walls.  It’d be beneficial to speak with:- Members of a school system who are also interested in this topic and how it can be applied in the community and classroom - Schools that are already committed to some sort of energy reducing program - Designers who have worked on kinetic playgrounds- Those who frequent farmers markets and/or have helped set one up - Members of community gardens who can speak to the setup- amount of work- maintenance- etc.  A combination of various types of renewable energy  A Group Brainstorm ,0,0
 The community sign up to share errand running. Working on a roster all signed up members do the whole communities errands in one go- rather than everyone doing their own.This gives a two short/medium term objectives and one longer term objective: 1) Cut down emissions of burnt fossil fuels2) Everyone signed up contributes the money they have saved on petrol or Diesel into the long term gain pot3) The long term gain pot will be used to purchase an Electric vehicle for the errand run for the future.  Mostly communities that use private transport for all errand runs- therefore a fairly wide demographic. The idea would likely have higher benefit for communities that have more disparate resources- therefore longer journeys for errands.  Short term gains- mean that less fossil fuel is used in everyday life- longer term gains greatly improve that with the introduction of EVs (Electric Vehicles). Exposure to using an EV in this way may also encourage users to be more inclined to replace their own fossil fuel vehicles with a capable EV.  To understand how this might fly would be to get some understanding of the interest locally of environmental concerns and how many members of the community would be interested in participating in the scheme.  Input of validity in people's time and mileage spent on errand runs that could be added to a community roster would start to flesh out the amount of mileage/money that could be saved in a sizeable community and therefore some ideas could be formed around time to purchase for the EV. This would give some validity or not to the communities ability to participate and achieve the longer term gain.  Electric vehicles  An Individual ,0,0
 In most secondary schools curriculums- pupils receive some sort of cooking and manual skills lessons. Why not let them make a solar panel to take home? It would be used (because parents would be proud of the achievement) and it would leave a memorable memory to the kid- who will become more knowledgeable about solar and renewable energy.  We are looking at local communities here. We are touching kids ages 8-14- who are late primary or early secondary school.The childrens parents will be engaged via their kids.For it to work- we need to engage headmasters/mistresses in the program.What's in it for them? Initially- the aura of being innovative and a pilot school. It might be easier to start with private schools that might be more able to modify and adjust what they teach.Eventually though- the idea is to get public school to adopt the program too.  The power of making something is incredible- and children can influence their parents. If kids understand what is involved in solar energy (because they are making panels)- how much energy is required to charge a mobile phone (in relation to the effort they made) and what you can use the energy generated for- I believe they will become responsible adults.Eventually- they'll be able to pick-up renewable energy when they can make their own choices- in 5 to 10 years from now- if not before.  For me- the first early and cheap experiment is to contact a school- ask if there are interested and make a pilot.I've contacted a few people and some are interested already (this is a good sign- I think) I guess- then we'llneed to test: - the scalability of the venture.We could probably systematically contact other establishment with a description of the project- and capture the number of signups (we can do this very lo-key with flyers- or door to door communication. - does it havethe expected effect in the community (i.e. are pupils and people more aware of what the could be using solar energy for)On this- I'm thinking we could perhaps we could survey child and parents before and after the workshop?Do other members of the community have other ideas?  I've got a lot of good ideas from the community already- thank you!If more people are interested in this idea- the ideo community could help with: - Finding a name for the program- and define more stuff the schools could do with the energy generated. - Testing the appetite for the idea by contacting their local schools. - Helping with the physics of the idea. I'm not sure at the moments how big the panel needs to be for what we need- although I'm thinking we Demand Energy Equality can help. - Understanding Health and Safety regulation that could prevent the project to see the light.- I think if it works- we'll have some PR to do too- so we'll need a website to refer too. Help there could be very useful.  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 Educate and motivate consumers to purchase pro-renewable products. Then use that consumer demand to encourage companies to measure their success with not only profits- but their positive impact on the environment and society too (The Triple Bottom Line).That one change in how a business officially measures success will provide the motivation for employees to make thousands of other decisions to support adoption of renewable energies.  If customers and society at large expect that businesses will measure and publicize their impact on energy consumption- then businesses will start to make decisions to improve these numbers.With consumer education efforts such as The Story of Stuff Project (http://storyofstuff.org/)- businesses that don't participate will lose consumers who care. As a result- smart energy consumption decisions could become a competitive advantage.  The business sector makes up a huge portion of energy consumption- policy lobbying- and pioneering/financing new ideas. This new measurement approach would steer those resources to find better solutions both in local communities and on the larger global stage with corporations.  1. Start by approaching small to medium sized- non-chain retail businesses in small towns. These owners know their customers and their customers know them. 2. Survey customers about sentiments of the business- their value to their community and their likeliness to be more loyal if the business made better energy decisions.3. Present easy to implement- low-cost changes they can make to improve their local community through better energy consumption. 4. Promote those changes to customers with foam core signs in retail stores.5.Measure customer sentiments- level of loyalty- and likeliness to spend more money with the business in the future. 6. Use this as a case study with larger businesses. The improved customer satisfaction- loyalty- and likeliness to buy more in the future can serve as justification for budgets for new initiatives and the marketing budgets to tell customers about them. CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON FEEDBACK:The laundromat is a great type of business to target considering their high energy usage. However- one challenge might be getting businesses make large capital expenditures before users have shown that they would become more loyal. Perhaps in-store surveys- anecdotal conversations- and pledge commitments could help justify the new expenses. Another approach could be to start with low cost additions. Washing machines last a long time and only need to be upgraded every 15 years (guessing). Maybe light bulbs- floor fans- ceiling fans- air conditioners- shifting business hours to daylight hours to cut down on lights- and insulation upgrades could be alternatives.  What types of practical changes would bring the biggest impact with the least amount of effort? Which changes are difficult- but also provide the biggest gains? How should we recommend prioritizing a long list of good initiatives?  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0

 Across the Northeast- hundreds of thousands of buildings still use fuel oil to produce heat and hot water. The collective soot- carbon dioxide and other pollutants that come out of these buildings' smokestacks have dire implications for public health and climate change. In urbanized areas- installing solar hot water systems on residential buildings makes much more sense than PV panels from an environmental- economic- and public health standpoint.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated that deploying solar heating on NYC buildings that burned the dirtiest fuel oil could reduce GHG emission by 260-000 tons- particulate matter emissions by 1-800 tons- and nitrogen oxide emissions by 13-500 tons each year.  Because soot is a known trigger for asthma attacks- installing solar hot water systems in lower-income communities that suffer high asthma rates is particular urgent. Northeastern state and local governments need to eliminate barriers and put in place the right incentives to promote the installation of SHW systems.Our children and our planet will thank them for it.

 It's Airbnb meets PG&E--apply P2P platforms to DERs- allowing individuals to directly sell excess electricity production from renewable energy.Electricity producers will be financially empowered- consumers will have cheaper and more renewable options- and the energy market will become more efficient.The expected outcome is that communities would rapidly transition to renewables as people increasingly profit from the energy sharing economy!  This idea will greatly benefit any community that uses energy from a centralized electrical grid.In developing countries- this idea has the potential to not only drive down energy prices but also financially empower individuals and communities.  By increasing access to cheaper sources of electricity- namely DERs- then communities will naturally pursue renewable energy sources.As the P2P energy sharing economy flourishes- potential producers will increasingly pursue a variety of cost-efficient methods of producing renewable energy in order to play in this market.  Develop the P2P platform and link one neighborhood with particulary low access to renewables with another neighborhood with a particularly high production of renewables.Analyze electrical usage and bills before and after the introduction of the P2P platform.

 Kids have energy. There's no doubt about that. Their favorite part of school is recess and they can't wait to get outside. What if we could use all of this energy to power places in our community- including our schools?Tiger Energy Biscuits- a Kraft company-used this same idea to build a playground. They partnered with a local university in the Philippines- working one year to create a playground that could capture energy used on the equipment to power their local community. This can be even more advanced- using other technology such as energy capturing tiles currently used at stadiums. This is a learning opportunity for kids and become cost effective for communities- and promote a school or business in the process.  The community: The cool thing about this is that it can be placed into any community.A community could plant a park- transform a park- add it to their schools- implement this into malls- theme-parks- anything! Once a community invests the time into making one- the parts and playground can be easily re-created for another location or purpose. If a city just wanted one swing set- they could just start out with that. With the money they save- they could grow their playground and their investment into even more opportunities for reusable energy.The people: Being a college student- I'm always looking for opportunities for projects like this to use my talents and make an impact- and I know I'm not the only one. Schools will want to be a part of this if it gives exposure to their university- and the opportunity for students to have a real-life experience. The kids: When I was a kid- we used to convince my teacher to give us extra recess. I know in second grade I would have so many questions of how the playground worked and why we were doing it. This could even be a fun way for schools and students to compete. They could see which class created the most energy- competing against their friends or even schools competing against schools.The city: This could create so much publicity for the city and others involved- going green is always a trend- and this is a cool way to promote it.  This idea isn't just about changing light-bulbs. This is about creating sustainable playgrounds that can power a city for years and years.Renewable energy- our focus is trying to change and develop things that already exist such as the oil industry- when we should be looking to completely new ideas (like Open IDEO is doing). If people want to have an impact on their planet- instead of waiting on someone else to change their energy- a community can start this on their own. They don't need to wait for a big company or organization- they can start making environmental change on their own!  1. Classes can start the discussion of energy- and start to brainstorm their own ideas and concepts for creating this renewable playground. This is the most cost effective and easiest way to see the potential of this project.2. Communities can host an even- putting things such as sustainable dance floors can be put in place to see how much energy a group of people can actually create! Their interest might start the discussion of putting this in place.http://www.sustainabledanceclub.com/products/sustainable_dance_floor/3. The company Playground Energy uses the energy from children- to create a better playground experience by adding light and sound with their energy used. Even just putting one of these items in place- you can begin to see value in the energy of kids.http://www.playgroundenergy.com/  This idea is good- but it can be something even greater.Post your input on how we can evolve this into something amazing!How can this playground improve your community?

Goals: Enroll 3 cities in 3 years to recruit 25% of households to reduce their carbon footprint by 25%Outcomes:Create social connection and networks around climate changeDevelop demand-side drivers for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologiesBuild political power for climate actionDevelop pathways for behavior changeEnroll cities to cooperate- bypassing the current political stagnationChange consciousnessI am familiar with this project but not involved in the rollout. I will reach out to the principals to see if they'd like to engage on OpenIDEO if there's interest.  The main players are the city politicians and staff; community organizers; block-by-block resident groups; individuals and families  The tools for real community engagement and recruitment exist. This research has been demonstrated as viable and is ready to scale. Once brought to scale- this methodology will engage individuals at the block level to implement carbon reduction strategies- including renewable energy. This is a perfect organizing tool to be added to system designs for community-scale renewable energy. Of then the technological solutions leave out the community-building solutions- which are the only viable pathway for fast adoption.  Some lightweight experiments have been completed.

 You are an electricity producing company and you receive thousands of letters/packages to your HQ- social media pressure- media buzz and so on. They are all asking your company- in a polite- non-aggresive and pro-dialogue way- that your company commits to renewable energy producing procedures. They are all coordinated. They are extremely powerful: One for all- all for one.  My post doesn't mention a specific type of energy  An Individual ,0,0
 The SunSaluter (www.sunsaluter.com) is a solar panel rotator designed for the developing world. Using only gravity and water- the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to rotate and follow the sun throughout the day- boostingefficiency by 30%. It also produces clean water!The SunSaluter is built from common components and is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized panel rotators (called trackers)- and is much more durable without complex components.Solar power is a proven way to alleviate energy poverty- but it is simply still too expensive for many poor consumers. By increasing efficiency and lowering the overall cost per watt- the SunSaluter can help communities afford the transition to clean energy!  The SunSaluter is ideal for poor- rural individuals living without electricity. These individuals earn just dollars a day and often spend more than 20% of their income on kerosene gas and walk hours just to charge their cell phones. Solar energy is a great tool for eliminating these problems- but it is often still too expensive up-front for them. By boosting efficiency and lowering the cost per watt of solar energy- the SunSaluter brings solar energy within reach. For example- a 150 watt solar lantern charging station which powers 75 lanterns can be outfitted with a SunSaluter to be capable of charging 25 more lanterns. The individuals living in unelectrified communities also often lack access to clean water- so the SunSaluter provides a great additional benefit.For example- at the OneMama Clinic in Kirindi- Uganda- a SunSaluter installation has allowed women at the health clinic to not only eliminate the usage of kerosene- but to create a phone charging business to bolster their income.“The mamas are so excited that this is bringing light into an area where they spend the most time- which is in the Kitchen area- and also bringing energy for them to charge cell phones and purifying water- so we’re using it for tea and for cooking dinner. The OneMama Clinic is very grateful to SunSaluter for bringing its wonderful technology to the OneMama Clinic and to Uganda.”- Siobhan Neilland- Founder of OneMama  By boosting the efficiency of solar panels by 30%- the SunSaluter lowers the overall cost per watt of solar energy and simply makes it more affordable. Excellent solar technology is already available in many markets - but cost is still a primary barrier to widespread adoption. The SunSaluter is also unique in that it be installed with new solar systems or used to retrofit existing systems. With over 2 gigawatts of off-grid solar capacity currently installed worldwide- the solar infrastructure upon which to use the SunSaluter already exists- and is growing every day. The SunSaluter is simple to build and requires no special equipment nor training- meaning any community can adopt it rapidly. Lastly- if we can get local entrepreneurs to manufacture and distribute their own SunSaluters- costs will decrease dramatically and hopefully instill confidence in the community to adopt the technology.  We have already deployed over 100 SunSaluters around the world - and every time we learn something new! Regarding outsourced manufacturing- we are beginning to work with a village in northern India where the locals will build their own SunSaluters and can either use them- sell them- or resell them back to us to provide our other customers. We will be making at least 30 systems with them in the coming months- and would really love to learn how to make the process beneficial to everyone involved. We are happy to try any suggestions that people have. And of course we're open to trying this approach with other partners around the world!  We would be grateful for any recommendations on how to set up a human-centered manufacturing and distribution partnership with these communities. What can we do to make sure it is beneficial to the community members- but also ensure standards of quality and reliability for us? What should we make sure not to do? Are there any partner organizations that you recommend that we work with? And of course- any technical or design suggestions are always welcome too - thank you!  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 Used Kitchen Oil Collection Program is really for anyone. Everybody cooks- everybody fries. And so everybody has leftover used cooking oil and in many cases does not know what to do with it. Only ahandful of countries have a working used kitchen oil collection program and the awareness is still very low. In third world countries and developing countries- often such oil isn't disposed properly because there are simply no means of doing so. By implementing a collection system in such countries- we not only protect the environment a little more- we also help to produce biofuels that can be reused over and over again as it is done in the UK for example.  This program would target local communities of Latin American countries where there is no working used oil collection system. Even if there is two restaurants that somehow recycle their used oil or dispose it relatively safely- the remaining fifty will pour the oil down the drain- which will clog the pipes of the entire building- street- neighborhood- city... Except for the local communities- this will be an initiative for those who are interested in using biofuels in order to either protect the environment- be more cost effective- or both.Strongly suggested would be to target children from elementary school- through high school to university by directly involving them in the program. Why? Simply because the future starts with the children. Educating them about biofuels will ensure their eco-responsibility standards to be higher. And how would this be done? The youngest ones could simply collect used cooking oil from their mom's kitchen and bring it to school that will then hand it over to the collection site. In the case of older children/teenagers- they could participate in the site collection directly as an extra curriculum activity.  Used cooking oil is a very fast way to obtain biofuels. It is everywhere and there is an abundance of it.  The first step in Bogota would be to simply do an on-site research. Talking to individual restaurant and stall owners and finding out how do they handle used oil and if they would be willing to participate in such a program.  This project will definitely need experts on biofuel production- environment safety experts- engineers- educators for the program and anyone who would be excited about the idea.

Throughout this project we will be working closely with a number of partners including The Transition Network- Regen SW and number of community energy groups & KEVICC and other local schools and community groups.We also intend to work with other professional musical theatre specialists and amateur dramatics groups and sponsors.Transition network:We will be working with the Transition Network to identify 5 transition groups to visit during the development of the project to explore some of the stories- questions- themes and challenges faced by people as they start to grapple with peak oil and climate changes.Regen SW: Regen SW is a centre for expertise in sustainable energy. For the past 10 years Regen SW has been working with 300 Community Energy Groups to support them in developing their own projects. Through this work- Regen SW has encountered a number of the challenges that we will be considering in the project. Regen SW will be supporting the project with communications and promotional support as well as ensuring that any funds are properly spent and accounted for.

Merlin’s reaction on being pitched the project that's bonkers: we should definitely do it KEVICC:KEVICC is the largest school in Totnes (1300 pupils) and is the home of The Ariel Centre which has a wonderful theatre space which can seat up to 300 people. The school have offered us space to develop the work and staff- students and the wider community will be involved throughout. Polly Morrow - Community Arts Coordinator'KEVICC has a long produced real quality performing arts shows and musicals- and are thrilled to think that our students might have the opportunity to collaborate with a community project such as this. Especially so as it reflects the links we have- and value- with Transition Town Totnes. It would add hugely to the students' experience and achievement and they are eager to be part of the project.'The products produced during the show will be able to be used by other groups - licenses for use of the music- script and score- films- documentary etc will be available for any group that wishes to engage people in questions about oil dependency and our future energy options - we have already identified 4 transition or community energy groups who have asked to use this material as well as an addition 8 choirs. We think that this materials will be of great help to any community groups who is dealing with these challenges.  One of the central challenges to the development of renewables is getting consent through planning- central to this is the problem of engaging people in the energy debate in a way that is not immediately polarising or negative. We want to raise awareness of the importance of our energy choices within the greater human narrative without the direct link to a specific project to build people's confidence to engage constructively through modelling behaviours- sharing information and creating a positive experience through humour and memorable tunes.  We have already worked with Matt Harvey as out poet in residence for the past 12 months producing a collection of poems which has been bought by 1300 people- performed to wide acclaim to over 8000 people in festivals and events and has recently been filmed and shared online. Poetry in general by its very nature- has a lot of hurdles to overcome (misperceptions about poetry bound and it can often seem boring to the uninitiated) Musicals tend to be more popular and this has been demonstrated with Matt and Thomas's recent show Rumpelstiltskin.We have also been trialling a variety of creative engagement tools an techniques toinvite people in to our activities and  We arecontinually developing creative engagement techniques ad would value any inputWe want to ensure that we produce appropriate and engaging materials that attract people to use the resources that are developed in the projectWe want to ensure that we are linked to networks with an affinity to this activity and that we're aware of other activity we can learn fromWe need financial support to maximise the impact of the project  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 This multi-media platform serves as a space to share both technical information and personal stories about transitioning to more renewable energy sources at the household level. Professionally produced video content in the style of reality TV episodes will give a glimpse into specific case studies of families who have made these transitions in tandem with details on how others can undertake their own projects. This content will then spur feedback on a forum in which others can comment- ask questions- and post about their own experiences in taking on similar projects.

 27 years’ worth of worldwide energy consumption equals only one day’s worth of solar energy hitting the earth. While we get more than enough sun to support our global energy needs- the two major barriers to solar energy are high capital cost and uneven sunlight distribution. A global exchange based on solar blocks tackles both barriers. By allowing individuals to adopt solar blocks (or equivalents such as small solar powered stoves) in underprivileged communities with ample sun but little capital- the system creates a mutually beneficial cycle. My sketches below illustrates the idea.  Any community can benefit. Two types of communities can particularly benefit from this. The communities of ample capital but irregular sunlight (ex. a rainy town in New York) can benefit from adopting solar blocks and receiving returns. Also- communities of ample sunlight but limited capital will benefit from the installation of solar generating blocks etc. One example is African communities. Over 85% of the African continent's landscape receives at least 2-000 kWh/(m² year). A recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the European Union.  The idea addresses two of the greatest barriers to implementing solar energy.  My community in New York doesn't get a lot of sun- but I can set up a simple site- calculate the cost for a solar block or equivalent to put on the site- and see how people react to potentially contributing.  One concern I have is fair distribution within the community. For example- if a community of 50 people gets 5 solar powered stoves- who will get the stoves? Or- how will the stoves be shared? I don't want there to be any tension in the community. I would love to learn more about this kind of social dynamic.  Solar  An Individual ,0,0

 Participate in PRIME’s proof-of-concept investment- Quidnet- by making a $100K-$400K: 1) grant to PRIME or 2) program-related investment (convertible note) directly to Quidnet (or to PRIME as nonprofit intermediary).Quidnet is a for-profit company deploying low-cost grid-scale energy storage. The company’s technology will provide energy developers and utilities with a solution for storing up to giga-watt hours of electricity at a cost point unachievable in the current marketplace. An early injection of philanthropic capital will allow Quidnet to complete its pilot project in West Texas and solicit follow-on investment from the private markets.  There are two distinct ways in which an early investment in Quidnet would benefit our communities in the US and abroad: 1) directly through the charitable impacts of Quidnet's core business and 2) indirectly as a proof-of-concept for PRIME.  Due to the intermittency issues associated with solar and wind electricity generation- energy storage is vital to deployment of renewables in any community.Unfortunately- the capital cost of the batteries included in a residential off-grid solar plus batteries system currently cost about $500 per kWh. However- to achieve cost parity with the grid- the capital cost of batteries would need to decline to about $20 per kWh.Absent a major technological breakthrough- battery costs are likely to remain above $20 per kWh for several decades. In 2012- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that battery costs would fall as low as $135 per kWh by 2035 in the best case scenario.Quidnet's unconventional solution could help us reach these goals much sooner and help communities all over the world transition to renewables without ongoing government or philanthropic subsidies.  Quidnet is testing its concept by using a spent oil well in West Texas as a pilot project. It is taking assets that sit idle -- spent oil and gas wells -- and turning them into a force for good.

 When we speak about renewable energy- we mostly speak about electricity energy production- less about energy efficiency that will maybe be an other OpenIdeo Challenge. Speaking about electricity production- US households use the one derived from oil- as the one we put in our cars. So what if we move the entire energy consumption of the household at once ? If we go electric for cars & homes- then we are not directly bound to oil and we can think about a relevant mix for our electric life. Household- neighborhood and local government may then better get the value of producing it locally- collaboratively and - because it becomes cheeper - renewably.  Main players are households - to update their devices and cars -Local governments or neighborhoods - to implement a relevant grid -and federal or national government - to incentive the switch to a full electric life.  It helps community to quickly get the fact that there energy bill is one single thing- in which- once they are free from oil- that have a say to choose their energy mix.Once households and local governments are aware of their energy mix- they can act locally to fuel the grid with a better and more relevant mix of energy- including renewables that are locally available.  A start with a Show House- fully equipped- to monitor the household energy bill ? Or lend electric vehicules to a neighborhood- to let them experience the Full Electric life and ask them about their energy mix then.  I'd love to get a better economic evaluation- to understand the investment needed- the incentive required- the money gained at the end and the renewable energy that is possible in the mix.

 How can 21st century women move around with their mobile devices- and keep them charged everywhere? How to do this in a sustainable way? Can renewable energies become fashionable? Our idea is to create trendy and sustainable solar handbags that modern women will enjoy carrying. Enhanced technology and design will also bring full autonomy to recharge mobile devices while respecting the environment. The handbags will be crafted by local artisans- leveraging local designs and contributing to the development of communities.We believe that fashion can be a strong shaper of mindsets- and thus convey to the world the message that clean energies can be used everywhere.  This idea benefits two communities. (1) Local community of a developing country. Handbags will be manufactured by native artisans building on top of existing designs. Adding innovative features- these communities will gain reach and relevance and therefore multiply commercialization opportunities. Proceeds will go back to the manufacturers- stimulating local economy. (2) Global women community. Handbags are not only an accessory used to carry things- but also a way to increase autonomy. Moreover- women will become a vehicle to spread usage and awareness of clean energies.  There are two ways in which this idea can accelerate the transition to renewables. Firstly- part of the proceeds of solar handbags could be dedicated to finance renewable energy projects for the community crafting the bags as a way to give benefits back. Secondly- it will create awareness for the users: Women will become more conscious of “clean” possibilities to power devices without losing their autonomy (i.e.- vs. powering devices at home). In addition- fashion is a way to set trends and influence sustainable behaviours.  The feasibility of the idea could be checked within the IE Business School community in Madrid (Instituto the Empresa). Two actions will be required: (1) Performing a customer survey to IE women. This audience is similar to the target market- and thus could provide valuable feedback on the willingness to buy the product. (2) Working with IE colleagues interested in energy and fashion to build a prototype to analyze technical and economical feasibility. Once feasibility has been proven- we will need to identify a community interested in crafting the solar handbags.

 Across America- local officials are constantly making choices that set the pace and scale at which renewable energy displaces polluting sources (or not)- like whether to keep an older fossil fuel plant running 20 more years- or replace it sooner with another energy option. But often these deciders don't hear directly from their customers or constituents on what they'd prefer for energy for their homes- and that's a barrier to clean energy progress if the large majorities who want more renewables aren't ever making that known or visible to local deciders. PicMyEnergyMix sets out to help solve that by providing electricity bill-payers a fun- easy tool to visually express and share their energy preferences so they can make a difference.  [UPDATED 1/30/15] There are many examples of communities that could benefit from this tool- and local public health- clean energy- community and environmental organizations that could help deploy it. For example- in Salt Lake City- Utah- the utility that provides electricity to most residents gets more than 60% of its power from coal-burning power plants and only about 10% from solar and wind. According to opinion surveys- residents in Salt Lake City would like to encourage more use of clean energy and less coal and want their utility to put greater emphasis on sources that don't cause pollution. So will the utility change accordingly? To what degree? Over what time frame? The answers to those questions may be influenced by the degree to which there is or isn't community appetite and demand for clean energy communicated visibly. Opinion polls don't matter if the issue isn't important enough for people to take an interest in and participate in. That's where PicMyEnergyMix comes in! It facilitates just that- and groups such as HEAL Utah (a public health group) are interested to help encourage participation in it.I mention Salt Lake City by way of illustration. Thesituation is the same in many other cities and states.  [UPDATED 1/30/15] Many people don't think about- or know much about- where there power comes from. Power plants are often not nearby and remain unseen. Utilities often don't make information readily available about how much they're using coal vs. gas vs. other sources. So one of the main ways PicMyEnergyMix helps change people's relationship to energy is by enticing people to think about it and reflect on whether they're actually getting the kind of energy they want (and are paying for). The enticing is done by creating a user-friendly- interactive- visual and personal way of providing this education- and offering an advocacy and social sharing component so there's more of a payoff than just education. A key step to changing the energy landscape to include greater renewables is moving energy issues forward from the back burner for consumers to something they think about and see how they can easily and enjoyably have a voice in.  [UPDATED 1/30/15] PicMyEnergyMix lends itself perfectly to trying out in just one or two cities or states to start with. So- for example- a version of the webapp would be done for just the utility that serves people in Salt Lake City -- and the site would just be promoted to Salt Lake City residents to participate. Then- if it's successful- versions could be created for many other communities. Eventually- these could even be all integrated together such that users could check out and compare and contrast what the current vs. desired energy mix pics look like across state lines or for different utilities. That could even create some healthy competition!  This is avisual project so of course the visuals on the site will really matter. The pictures I've uploaded are just rough mock-ups by a non-designer- so this will really benefit from much better graphics and art advice from any and all with those skills. There are questions too about whether to just have the picture be an icon-style house or apartment with color wash over it- or whether to potentially enable people to upload a photo of their own home that gets colored in by the site? Of course- want to keep the number of steps down to a minimum to encourage participation... could be something to test? Promotional ideas beyond the usual? Take a tablet door to door for people to use (more fun than signing a petition)? Have a few ipads at a table at events for people to use the tool? Would media be interested?

 Why don't we conserve more? Even in perilous drought- conservation results are rarely above 10%. If we are going to solve the challenges of climate change and water scarcity- we need orders of magnitude improvements. Water and energy conservation is economically and ecologically valuable. We should treat it as such. We are creating a marketplace for sustainability. MeterHero Savers can volunteer to increase their water and energy efficiency and get paid by those seeking to offset their water and energy consumption. If I am a restaurant in a community- I have to use water and energy- but I can offset my use by funding rebates to those who are doing their part to save. Together- these community partners can make a huge difference.  This idea helps everyone in the community. It encourages people to save water and energy. It helps companies promote their sustainability work and give back to their communities. If you are a school- you can earn money for your programs by saving water and energy and you can teach students about the importance of conservation. The average household can earn about $10 per month each for water and energy. Payments continue as long as energy and water savings continue. Businesses with a triple bottom line can connect with customers who share the same values around sustainability. These become customers for life. And when kids learn about the importance of conservation at school- they adopt habits that follow them into adulthood.  If I'm a household that uses an average of 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day and I install a solar panel that produces 10 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day- I will reduce my average consumption to 20 kilowatt-hours per day. That means- I will earn $60 per month in rebates before making any other changes. At the same time- my local business can offset that amount of its own energy use- bringing it closer to net-zero by funding my rebate. Now the decision to install solar panels is an easy one to make. If I can make money by investing in renewable energy- it's an easy decision - even if I'm leasing the panels and not otherwise seeing a benefit. When we view our water and energy savings as something that creates value- we fundamentally change our approach to consuming these resources.  We are actively testing this in the community! We have hundreds of people around the country saving water and energy and earning rebates. We are close to announcing the first round of rebate sponsors. We need more people to volunteer as MeterHero savers and more businesses to step up as sponsors to bring the idea closer to the mainstream.  How do we bring more people into the program? What are the best ways to get people to think about water and energy not as a utility that they consume- but as a resource that they own and have responsibility over? We must change our public perception of conservation so that it's not something that happens privately- but rather it becomes an act that is visible to others and is linked to a broader community effort.

 The We can power change movement is a slogan by Microsoft youthspark Hub which our team member ( https://openideo.com/profiles/114966616225005465962 ) is part of.This idea is for the needy children in the low income areas and rural areas in Nairobi Kenya. We plan to Brighten up their lives in order to uphold their future using a green mobility solution that saves the ozone layer in upcoming rural town centers. We plan on hiring bicycles at the Universities and colleges to ease movement within these areas at an affordable rates to both students and lecturers. The funds will assist the team to realize our mission of brightening up lives.  We are mainly aiming the most affected areas which is the rural areas but as we move- we will expand to urban centers and GO GREEN. This project is for the youth on an age bracket of 16 years old and above. I believe this will also make the numerous unemployed youths utilize there energy in good exercise that also very healthy.  The Main subject for the whole idea is to generate funds to light up thedark life of our upcoming generation by investing on solar bulbs for the beautiful children born each and every day in poor families here in Kenya. we plan to buy 1.5 million solar bulbs and supply them to schools and homes in Western- Central and Eastern Kenya by doing this we will brighten up their lives and brighten up their future in an all green project. No more sad families.  We are actually doing this from experience because we also lived without electricity in Nairobi for six month which was very hectic.we bought a d-light solar panel kit from a Safaricom shop under the M-Kopa package which helped us study late night and early morning. This gave us a vision and a responsibility to help other people. We believe darkness cannot dive out darkness- only light can do that. Like hate cannot drive out hate- only love can do that as Martin Luther King Junior said.  The input we need for our idea is mostly moral support and funds to buy more bikes to spread the movement.

 In order to sustain meaningful and long-lasting solutions in renewable energy- we can leverage college campuses- and the local economies they reside in- to create stronger platforms for collaboration around renewable energy.  The main players would be college students and faculty. Businesses in close proximity to college campuses would be the main beneficiaries- but the communities affected could be as large as the entire state in which a college in located.  Integration of renewables into college curriculums is beneficial from an educational stand point alone in order to rapidly deploy information. With the addition of partnerships with local economies/businesses- school coursework could provide learning opportunities to students- as well as tangible results within a semester given the challenge at hand. While implementation may take longer- fresh ideas and notional solutions can develop quickly with the introduction of students.  We can start by gaging the interest of local executives or professors at the universities that we have contacts. We can also begin to decipher effective course-work or challenges based on specific locales.  A combination of various types of renewable energy ,0,0
 Any time I've ever attended a climate conference- there's always a stationary bicycle that when pedalled contributes to the event's energy use. I'm curious to see what would happen if a gym was converted into a source for exerting energy that is later contributed locally. All that effort exerted into weight machines- treadmills- stationary bikes- and ellipticals could help generate energy. It would not only save the local community on their electric bill- but will also encourage a healthier lifestyle for all.  This could help benefit urban and rural areas that have an interest in personal wellness and contributing to power their local community. The power generated could be donated to local shelters- nonprofits- or schools that are potentially struggling to keep their lights on.  I think that this idea could be a revolution in inspiring others to take 'charge' in renewables because turning a routine activity like going to the gym into something that is contributing to your community is motivation to return to that gym and not to join others. I think people will be more inclined to work on their personal wellness if they know that the effort they're exerting is helping others. This could create a domino effect for other fitness centers- nightclubs- and recreation facilities to convert their machines as well.  I think a preliminary experiment would be to set up half of the treadmills with this technology with a nearby chart explaining why the machines look a little different. If people are more inclined to use the power-generating bikes that create energy for a nearby location then my theory would be confirmed.  I would need to learn more about how to store energy which can then be transferred over to other locations to use.  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 What if an educational environmentally-friendly packet was included for each new lease agreement or home owner? It would include tips to save energy in the home- ideas to re-use energy and free consultation to retrofit your home (if applicable). The idea is to educate the community- make an actionable plan- and create impact right away!  It allows everyone to get involved and start saving within the home. Of course- not everyone can retrofit their living space- but there are other ways to save and contribute. I think people forget how easy it is and if reminded or educated with the right information- can create an impact.  Contacting my rental property to talk to them about likelihood of distribution- as well as after polling my community- putting together a pamphlet based on favorite tricks to save energy.  I'd love to hear the community's favorite tips and tricks to save and re-use energy around their living space(which could later be used in the previously mentioned pamphlet to include with a lease).

 Look around the landscape and look at the use of electricity. We use it everywhere and we do not care. We think if we use an electric lawn mower we are helping the environment.A push mower does the same job better and never needs electricity after it has been manufactured. If you can reduce demand for electricity you will reduce carbon emissions. Then you can increase alternatives. Today we are gluttons for power with our TV- computer- cell phones- heating and cooling.Improve heating and cooling and you will see dramatic reduction in electricity demand.  Large population centers benefit first because you have more energy demands. You also have more home building in larger communities and therefore can have a more dramatic impact by building more energy efficient homes and buildings.  If you were to get a 10 percent reduction in electricity use and therefore a 10 percent reduction in coal power think what that does to carbon before you even think about a solar system or a wind system.  LED's- more insulation- newe windows- window shades- home design to improve heat and cooling.  A combination of various types of renewable energy  A Group Brainstorm ,0,0
 The Public Plug showcases the generation of excessiverenewable energy by a plug that is publicly available.  This idea is for renewable pioneers who have a running system for renewable energy. The plug is their conversation piece with the following messages: - renewable energy is effective - I've got more than I actually need - I'm generous and sharing my energy with you  The Public Plug is a conversation starter to inspire more people to use renewable energy sources.  One could easily install a Public Plug prototype on a busy street in a sunny or windy city- start a conversation with some pics on social media and see what happens.  This idea needs some skilled designers and someone with a solid knowledge how the feed-in of excessive energy is managed in power circuits.

 My idea is to conceive a series of smart parking spaces for shopping centres- which are connected via internet and are able to communicate through an app. All these parking spaces will be powered by solar cells. The aim of this concept is to reduce dramatically carbon emission- but also cutting paper waste. The app would be able- not only to provide informations about the nearest parking available it will also manage the access to the parking via an NFC/RFID or QR allowing the payment of the parking fee.  The users involved will be all the customers that will go to a shopping centre.I had this idea after looking for an available parking slot in a shopping center in southern Italy during the Christmas holiday. I wandered for more than 20 mins looking for an available parking slot- wasting a lot of fuel. Age groups: adults 18+ (anyone who drives a car) Location: shopping centres  If we implement this idea- we will be more environmentally friendly. We won't use paper ticket anymore (we won't need to print paper tickets out)- we won't waste our fuel and also we will implement the use of solar energy for all the parking slots available.  We will surely need some programmers to develop the app- but also engineer to develop the parking slot stations able to communicate with the devices.  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 We crowd fund solar projects so that energy savings can be invested to support broader community aspirations- from creating employment for people recovering from homelessness- through to scholarships for organic farmers. If you have a social mission- we can solar power it. We are creating a hub and spoke network of people spanning the globe- with volunteers on the ground identifying solar projects and community needs and using The People's Solar to finance them from a global community- while tracking and celebrating community development outcomes. (updated visual below with trial infographic- strategy map and business model planning - Huge thank you to Deirdre and the IDEO team!)  The platform can benefit any community- anywhere in the world. Currently we focus on creating solar projects that help address food security- sustainable food production- and social equity issues. For example- we are working with a farmer to crowd fund a solar project- so that energy savings can be invested in an organic farming scholarship. We also have a project where energy savings will be invested in training and employment creation for people living in social housing. We find people give to our projects because of the broader community benefit- not just because it's solar power. For example- if a village in Africa needed secure funding to help run a school- we could crowd fund an solar/off-grid energy solution- saving them money- so they can invest savings to support the school. In this way- the model can be adapted to community needs anywhere in the world.  The People's Solar gives people control and autonomy over their energy futures- so they no longer have to rely on governments or businesses to do the right thing- or provide financial support for renewable energy. This accelerates the speed of transition- and takes control away from incumbent interests that may try to slow down the speed of change. By linking the benefits of solar power to broader community needs- a broader base of financial support can be reached- helping to accelerate the transition to renewables.(update: note- we can crowd fund other renewable energy technologies- subject to them being the most appropriate and cost-effective for a given situation- and have projects in our pipeline that include off grid energy systems for remote communities in Australia)  We have already delivered three projects and have shown the model works. We have a growing pipeline of projects in excess of 100kW across Victoria- Australia and would love to scale our model globally. We have found the key to successfully fundraising for projects- is to engage people directly on the ground- and to leverage social networks. Most people give because they know and trust their money is going to deliver an outcome they value. Some people give as more of a faith based act of generosity- but they are in the minority (we estimate 20% for our projects so far).(Update - we are currently conducting experiments with our revenue model. We are starting to earn revenue through referrals/sales of solar systems to households- with leads generated by our platform. We are also starting to switch people to a clean electricity retailer- to earn extra cash for our projects- and referral fees for us)  We are open to ideas! Some conversation starters below(update - that you so much to Deirdre for her insightful thoughts and great sketches that have neatly summed up some of our strategic partnership and business model options! - check our visualisation section)(updated - we have also had a go at infographics- and have developed some templates to help us streamline data gathering- so we can measure and report on our impact. Thanks Meena!!)We would love some help with developing some really tight processes around measuring and reporting on the social impact we are having in communities- and ideally integrating that with our web platform so that the data gathering and reporting is seamless. For example- it would be amazing if we could send the people we have done projects with a form to fill out to document the impact of our solar project- with data gathered being represented on our website visually in some way- so that people can see the impact our projects are having in real-time.We would also love some help with identifying and developing the right strategic partnerships globally with NGO’s and philanthropic groups- including those that have relationships “on the ground” with communities that can leverage our model.

 Open source licensing of industry best practices such as technical specifications- standard designs- proven equipment- and construction guidelines will enable community based investors around the world to build low cost- best in class- bankable renewable energy projects.  This will affect communities around the world by making investment in renewable energy more cost effective and closer to home.  Open source with trusted community support will cut down on the red tape required to build a solar PV power plant by making it accessible to smaller investors.  Feedback from the OPENIDEO community will be my experiment. Open source is still hard to sell to the solar and construction industry.

 Our idea is an interactive worksheet that tackles the challenge of designing renewable energy projects that effectively motivate whole communities by teaching project leaders to assemble a wider range of motivations for their communities.  This idea will benefit all kinds of communities. One thing that stays the same across the diverse communities that will adopt renewables is human psychology. Since knowledge about psychology is the core of our idea- we believe that our idea addresses a need in every community. We’ll know more once we’ve tested it in a broad array of communities.The main players are the people tasked with their community's renewable energy project. They will benefit from using this tool during the planning/design phase of their project.[Updated 7 Feb 2015]  It equips change agents and community leaders with a deeper understanding of how motivation works- teaching them to assemble a wider range of motivations for their communities to adopt renewables. [Updated 4 Feb 2015]  Ask friends and RE enthusiasts to imagine planning a community-based RE project with the help of our tool.

 Similar to the Green Energy Social App the idea is to help energy consumers understand their contribution to their community and know where their money goes via an application that provides an engaging customer experience that is fun- entertaining- transparent and communicative of their energy use and money savings.  Main Stake Holder: Customers/Community - Customers include individual households who are in college- have graduated and have jobs with income $35-000 a year or greater. Other customers include construction and development companies that want a fully integrated product to new homesMedium and large business thatwant to phase in the system into their walls.City Government - Cities can capture the taxes not paid by large companies and use it to purchase renewable energy infrastructure. When cities adopt it wholly individuals will eventually transition due to modern systems needed to communicate with the new systems. High Tech Company - Different business model compared to electric company retailers Electric Company - Exempt from taxes because it provides the infrastructure that the city paid for.  Who ever is familiar with the Sims City Build It- and automatic lighting systems? A consumer's relationship to energy changes in a way that s/he has direct control of where and when s/he wants power in a specific location of the house and in how many power outlets should be used for standby machines such as tv's- dvrs- sound systems- etc. all through the power of their cell phone. Sensors that similar to automatic lights should have the capability to have back up power so that it is not using power directly from the source. They should also be able to communicate via WiFi to provide a layout of the home's floor plan.When a user selects the power icon on the dashboard of their phone/tablet/computer- they would be able get a wire frame of their floor plan- and visually obtain a snapshot as to where current is flowing. If their is any leakage it prompts a user to fix the issue to save the customer money.At the end of the month when their bill comes in they would be able to measure themselves against other members in their city to encourage friendly competition and improvement in their behavior. Customers should be able to create their username etc to keep customer information private. This should also change a customers behavior in relationship to the community because they would be able to see how the money they pay is working for them.  It would be easy to develop an engineering blue print of the product and create a website showing the product specifications. Video on a website on how it works and how it shows that people who like to to be in control of their money can save more money on their electric bill. A marketing message would sound something like:If your the type of person who likes to be in control and save money on your electric bill- we have a product that is right for you. Our product lets you control the amount of power in your home where and when you want it. Please visit our website for product specification.  1st tothink about the loopholes that exist in the business model and how to close them.

 Oil is politics. Most recent example is Saudi Arabia forcing the oil price down so troublesome countries like Russia and Iran get into economic troubles.These geopolitical strategies are directly impacting local communities and according to some this is very important to strengthen and stabilisethe world economy. How can local communities link this geopolitical game to renewable energy?  The main players are the people in local communities who can directly contact their local representatives. The 'renewable tax' can be used to subsidize solar panels on roofs or starting campaigns to raise awareness.  If the politicians show willingness to support this subsidizingidea it will be easier for renewable companies to get loans. The banks will find it less risky to give loans if there is a broad support.This can have an immediate impact.  Approach some local filling stations and see if the want to up their price slightly. It needs to be in a big area not just one filling station. This research will prove if there is willingness with the filling station owners to follow up on this plan.One way of convincing them is that the money collected will be used toinvest in a electric charging point in their filling station.  This subsidize idea is just one of the possibilities. The main point is that we create awareness of the direct impact of geopolitics on local communities. The OpenIDEO community could help out with alternative plans to influence politicians and the big players. If executed well- everyone can benefit. House owners- filling station companies- councils- politicians and even big energy suppliers.They all should work together.As long as we try to overcome our differences and try to come upideas who can benefit all- we can start small and grow bigger with every success we make.In short: We can turn Oil Geopolitics to our (local) advantage!

 E+P Innovation Labs aims to create a replicable- scalable model for collaboration among the oil and gas (O&G) industry- community-based/development organizations and renewable/technology start-ups. A collaborative approach among players with the right technical and local knowledge is required to create and deploy a renewable energy solution successfully.Innovations for above-ground social and environmental challenges are the except- not the rule- in the O&G industry- yet it has the talent- financial resources and external motivators to tackle renewable energy solutions.  The Houston community will be the first to benefit- since the initial E+P Labs will form in Houston- the energy capital.The first project will focus on providing access to renewable energy to underserved communities- likely by leasing solar panels/farms to these areas.  Houston is not a progressive city as far as renewable energy.If underserved communities gain access to cheap- affordable solar power -- or some other type of solution -- that will be a good starting point for converting other demographics who can afford it- as well as taking the solutions abroad to more logistically challenging and resource-constrained locations.  As stated above- the first projectcould focus on providing access to renewable energy to underserved communities- likely by leasing solar panels/farms to these areas.  How willing would international development / community based organizations be to contribute financial and human resources to the Labs? Renewable energy/tech companies?For this to be a truly collaborative effort- with relatively equal weight for decision-making- I think all parties must sponsor the Labs and its efforts with human and/or financial resources.What would be a good way to structure the business model to ensure collaboration and sufficient financial resources to scale?

 Solar sharing programs have been developing in concept since at least 2006 and still have yet to be implemented in major cities. This idea is to move solar sharing into action by creating a viral incentive structure based on SBS that aims for 100% participation by 2020. The SBS program would build shared solar panels for one city block on utility poles and invite residents to buy in. The incentive structure would use solar sharing as an access point to gain participation at the following levels: city block- neighborhood- city quadrant- city. Local energy companies- local government- NGO's or private industry would provide incentives like energy credits- infrastructure improvements- funding and recognition to encourage residents to enroll.  City residents (owners and renters)- city and state leaders and environmental advocacy groups benefit most from this idea to take solar viral through solar sharing- though there will be significant ripple effects as major cities begin to decrease their dependence on non-renewable energy sources. The main players will be local energy companies- local and state government agencies- solar installation companies- private companies- NGO's- city homeowners and the press. Other players may include federal agencies like the US Department of Energy.  Rapid scaling is a core concept of taking solar viral - starting with a city block- then moving to a neighborhood- a quadrant- and finally- an entire city. With incentives growing larger at each level city residents will be invested in engaging their fellow residents. When fellow residents see the ease and success SBS brings their neighbors they will be inspired to start a campaign on their own block. When city leaders are rewarded by public recognition of becoming a greener city they will move to further support the SBS program through the press- as will environmental advocacy groups. This model can start with one person and easily spread through an entire city. Individuals can be working on different blocks simultaneously to increase the speed of adoption and advocacy groups could assign campaigners to go out and talk to residents face-to-face. Incentives could be provided for how quickly- as well as how thoroughly- SBS is adopted at each level.UPDATE:There will definitely need to be a social media element of this program in order to really facilitate the rapid transition to SBS. There are some great app proposals on this challenge that could integrate nicely.  Developing an early lightweight experiment for this idea would be as easy as:1. Researching estimated cost of shared solar panel installation on a utility pole;2. Drafting a sample buy-in contract to float to my neighbors in San Francisco;3. Discussing the contract with my neighbors to gauge interest in a program like this. San Francisco would be a great place to start as it is a very green-friendly city!  This is primarily a policy idea based on the support and buy-in of local energy companies and city government. Local government leaders need to fundamentally support moving the city to renewable energy (and specifically shared solar)- therefore anyone from the OpenIDEO community with urban planning policy experience or connections would be a great asset to the viral SBS launch team. The team could also use someone with solar engineering skills to provide input on the specific wiring strategies to connect homes to a shared set of panels- as well as someone who could shed some light on the detailed economic model currently in place within local energy companies.UPDATE:This team could also greatly benefit from a marketing and branding specialist who could help create an official name- logo and brand. This will be critical for the program to go viral successfully.  Solar  A Group Brainstorm ,0,0

 Encourage building of green buildings.We can save - and generate - a lot of energy if we think about how we design our structures before we physically create them.If designs are conscious of energy-saving techniques- the structures themselves- not just what goes on inside them- can be more sustainable.  This idea benefits any community where a structure is built (so basically- every community).The main players are those who design the structure and those who build it- those who will use it- and most importantly- the community that benefits from it.  When a community's buildings are designed with sustainability in mind- this includes making structures that would be optimally compatible with renewable energy practices and technologies.This idea is meant to facilitate and encourage the use of energy-saving and energy-harnessing ideas already available- specifically those whose main obstacle to widespread adoption is the impracticality of integrating them with structures that are not very conducive to energy-saving/harnessing measures.  A lightweight experiment in my own community may be difficult- as designing and building a new structure isn't easy or cheap.I do have a previous example that comes to mind: several years ago in my community (Troy- MI) there was a designing contest for a house that would be completely self-sustaining as far as energy- and the winning design was actually built (I think Solar energy was a main part- but the house itself was meant to maximize efficiency)- and used to teach the community about renewable energy and environmentally sound styles of living.That's my proof: it already was done.Since it is clearly possible- we simply need to encourage wide-spread adoption of such environmentally friendly designs.  Any suggestions on how to encourage eco-friendly designing/building practices? Any idea of specific obstacles to overcome- other than people not knowing how necessary and practical renewable energy is?  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 This idea is more a discussion on different kind of incentives- from personal to community- direct and in-direct. I think different people and communities need different kind of incentives- depending on their situation and also depending on the maturity of the community and solution.I hope to provide a framework or model that can be used when coming up with solutions for different communities- and in that way avoid to invent the (incentive) wheel every time. This is what I describe here.  This incentive thinking is of benefit for many different communities- as it will put context to what works in different settings. For a very affluent community it might be enough to change to renewable because it is a good thing to do- while other communities might be more interested in lowering costs both short and long term. The players are mainly those who can provide incentives- e.g.- cities- states- countries etc (that can give tax-credits but also in some places own the utility companies) - the utility companies that can use incentives to change business models- but also communities that if large enough can put pressure on a utility company.  Incentives are a powerful driver for change- and if carefully used can build long-lasting changes into a community. Incentives can be the small change that bring enough people onboard to make that big change- and in some cases be the only way to change.  For example get the owner of the house I live in to install easy ways to sort my waste to enable it turning into bio-fuel I can lower my rent- or installing solar panels to run machines that is paid for by all tenants.  I would like to hear about more ideas on types on incentives that people have seen. I have given a few links to research done by other people- but I am sure there are more out there.

 Let's enable consumers to 'do good' for the environment with their everyday choices and purchases.  The idea can benefit any community that (ECO) chooses to get involved with. There are two sides to this idea; the first would be the community of satisfied consumers who purchases their goods and the second would be the community whose 'green' projects are benefitting. The key players would be the companies who currently makes cool- hip products that stand to gain from a greener image as well as the consumers who are equipped with the funds to help but are unable/unsure of how they can support the cause.  By aggregating individual- incremental consumer choice- (ECO) would help fund capital-intensive energy projects as well as educate the public about what their individual actions can contribute to. (ECO) will help people understand the power of their choices.  Because the idea twisted product (RED)'s offerings- several assumptions can be safely made; that the consumers want to support a social cause- that consumers would donate to a cause disconnected with their own benefits- that support is readily available from other commercial entities. An interesting lightweight experiment would be to find out what facts and figures do people respond to best- and what kind of stories to tell. Other questions that remains unanswered is how will the money be distributed or used? Is there a threshold (like 40 cents a day- like with (RED)) for collecting contributions? Who would be interested in collaborating with (ECO)?  I am very much open to ideas and feedback! Coming from a technical background- I see this as a very practical- realistic initiative so I would like to hear from designers and ideas brainstormers on some moonshots :) What are something unique I could pivot this into? Specifically- I would like to hear from people familiar with non-profit work to elaborate on how these kinds of initiatives could play out in the real-world and what forms do these initiatives already exist?

 The idea it to make visible the level of renewable energy used in the production of goods by adding a logo on the packaging (the same way we display how organic a product is or if a product is fair trade)  Initially- this would work for young adult- urbanpeople- in age of being employed- and rather educated. I am hoping that the can pass on the habit to their children.  The difficult area is to identify how much renewable energy has been used to manufacture complex product- but we could test fairly easily if the community react positively to the labels- if they notice and how much importance it has over other criteria (like price of goods) by sticking some labels on products in local markets and see how people react to it.

 Puzzle games are a great way for kids to work on their problem solving skills. What if we could design a game that could show how PV solar systems work and how to design them?  This would mainly benefit developed countries where ipad- smartphone use is high amongst youth. We could also make a computer version that could be played in areas who don't use smartphones- ipads etc as prevalently. I think this game is too complicated for kids under the age of middle school (so 12+.) Education level will be some math skills necessary and definitely literacy.  In order for our world to rapidly transition towards renewables- we first need to create awareness and improve education. Children are the future of this revolution and so focusing on their educational needs will only improve the chances of this revolution taking flight in the near future. Getting children interested in STEM fields (especially Environmental STEM jobs) is crucial for the rapid development of this industry.  I have no app development experience so I would love if someone who does wouldn't mind joining my team. Otherwise- I think I could definitely create a paper version and test it out on a group of kids.  App developers! I really need your help on this. I have no experience designing and programming apps.

 The weather in the Bay Area is wonderful. Perfect for biking. How can we reduce the daily carbon footprint by cutting down the number of people commuting by car and shuttle?It's upwards of 35 miles to Silicon Valley but that's a reasonable and enjoyable bike ride IF the support infrastructure is in place. Build a continuous bike path between San Francisco and Silicon Valley so that commuters can bike the 35 miles easily.Install space-saving and more secure bike harnasses in public transportation so that it's less awkward to travel with your bike on the Caltrain/BART!  The South Peninsula has become the home of technology giants like Google- Apple- Facebook- etc.San Francisco has begun to make room for big tech companies too like Twitter.These huge companies invest millions of dollars in hiring top talent from around the world.Unsurprisingly- these talented- new employees often want to live in the city and work in the suburbs. Or vice versa.Also- these employees are generally 25-50 years old and prime candidates to do a 35 mile bike ride at a pace faster than 12 MPH reducing the commute to under 3 hours.They are highly educated individuals who are super dedicated to their work but still want to maintain high quality of life.In the end- this benefits the entire Bay Area community by reducing congestion on the highways and shrinking the daily carbon foot print.  This idea doesn't rely on any new technology but it does require a significant effort in acquiring a continuous strip of land to dedicate as a bike path.I believe that by offering an easier and more enjoyable way to bike to work it will significantly reduce the areas reliance on gas.Harness the energy generated from the ~150 minutes of pedaling to charge the commuter's laptop- cell phone- etc.  1. There's a dedicated group of rugged cyclists who do this already.They are SF2G and this is how they describe themselves- [we] make it fun & practical to ride your bike to work from San Francisco to points down the peninsula- often as far as Google- Apple- Facebook- nVidia- etc. Commutes are typically 20-50 miles. Riding that far in the morning is a lot more enjoyable with a posse- so SF2G was created to facilitate that.]http://sf2g.com/index.html2. The Bay Area has a Bike to Work Day every year. http://www.youcanbikethere.com/.This organization releases a survey to everyone who participated in Bike to Work Day about biking habits.It would be great data.  I am SURE there is a better design for loading a massive amount of bikes into a small area.I would be so excited to explore the design and engineering of a smarter public transit bike storage system.After a vigorous bike ride in the morning and a full day of work -- the last thing a commuter wants is to awkwardly shove their bike onto a pile and then stress about whether they can get their bike out in time for their stop.

 A Social App to engage communities into the use of green energies- through a friendly competition.For example- Peter installs a solar panel at home and gets 100 green points reaching the top of his community's Green Ranking and becoming the Green Mayor. Peter's points will accrue for his Community that will ‘compete’ against other Communities.  As the App becomes more popular- we can define larger Communities. This app is thought for young people- with a clear concern for sustainability.  The friendly competition will accelerate the transition into renewables. The social status will trigger people's pride and desire to top the ranking. Similar to what happens with other apps- such as foursquare.  The app should be relatively easy to prototype. Then- we can try it with small predetermined communities.  All feedback is welcome! Please write your thoughts and help making this idea better.

 Let's create a website with DIY projects that kids and teenagers (with help- if needed) can build at home or for school science fest. This will make young generations more aware about renewable energy and its benefits and make the whole process more entertaining.  This idea potentially creates strategic benefits for a wide range of communities that would be redesigned by future visionaries and change agents inspired by renewable energy ideas at a young age. The serviceable market is basically all teens/parents with access to the Internet (as a potential future step- sending project descriptions via text messages could be considered to access certain disadvantaged communities).  This will raise the new generation of people who are much more aware of renewable energy- its methods and benefits- and therefore are both open to testing new energy solutions and even contributing with their own ideas. If we want a large-scale transition- we need to design and spread new worldviews in the first place.  Select and test projects first. Just pick one particular school/class and try some cool projects out with students. Gradually shift to online communication building a simple prototype of the website.  I would appreciate feedback and links to resources.Any kind of collaboration is most welcome- especially if you have background in education or web development.

 Break the bank by literally breaking the bank. Our society has progressed from trade to currency to plastic-credit card systems- to digital payment. We have the capability of adding a new currency that is centered around making choices that promote positive behavior- and in this case- green-energy based savior. Give positive reinforcement to individuals that choose renewable energy. Give large sums of convertible Green Notes to local communities if their local government consensus leads to a socially impactful renewable energy decision.Yes- the government already gives rewards for renewable based changes. But whats stopping us from making this a widespread currency-marketed- balanced- and human centered?  Directly Benefits: The individual and locally governed communities---Big Picture Benefits: Society- planet earth---Main Player: Federal government  It creates positive reinforcement and positive competition within each local community. Each local community will strive to reach Green-Note goals to receive perks and benefits as a local community; almost as a race for good against other local communities. Tax votes will go towards renewables to receive these local perks- as will individual dollars. Creating positive reinforcement around renewable adoption will yield long-lasting benefits through evolution- as participants will associate gain with renewable energy- a concept to be passed through generations for a long-lasting effect.  Local governmental partnerships with local businesses to provide perks to the community for large free (educational- entertaining) community events-in exchange for local legislative passing of a small tax bill to promote renewable energy in the community. ---Partnerships with car dealerships to lease cars out at 'x' cheaper price to lease renewable energy based car. Partner with gas stations to include more electric chargers or renewable pumps for said cars. ---Public school green awareness initiatives- having public school kids reinforcing parents at home of this need to switch to renewables. Create Green Notes within school districts to act as currency to see how young students are reacting to Green Notes for positive green-behavior.

 Greenfographic is a tool that gives your environmental efforts a score and creates infographics based on your efforts. Working with an energy consumption tracking app- such as SmarTraq- Greenfographic will import your energy consumption data- and create a telling and catching infographic.It maps important data about your environmental behaviors and it will help you to form better and more sustainable behaviors.(SmarTraq is similar to Fitbit in that it helps you track how much you have “worked out” for the environment- and Greenfographic will present your workout in a clear and creative way.)  Everyone can join and every community can benefit from this. What skills- input or guidance are you keen to connect with from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further? This idea is built upon SmarTraq and PicMyEnergyMix. Please see the right side of the webpage to find them.With the help from the OpenIDEO community- this idea has evolved a lot. We look forward to your participation- and let us know if you come up with a different name for this green infographic tool.  This idea is built upon the research Tidy Street: Changing Neighbors' Behaviors through Voluntary Monitoring and Public Infographics- and the ideas SmarTraq and PicMyEnergyMix.Please see the right side of the webpage to find them.

 Let's communicate environment conservation tips to airplane passengers as an in-flight featured presentation.  Airlines stand to gain significant cost savings by going green and encouraging travelers to follow suite. One source (50waystohelp.com) claims the cost of processing a paper ticket is approximately $10- while processing an e-ticket costs only $1. In the near future- e-tickets could save the airline industry $3 billion a year.If airlines present tips and tricks for going green to their customers- they may take more significant steps towards reducing their carbon footprint—such investing in hybrid aircrafts- recycling engine wash water- using environmentally friendlier cabin materials (a la Southwest).Hybrid aircrafts:(http://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2014/12/26/hybrid-electric-airplane-successfully-tested-in-the-uk/) Southwest's green initiatives: https://www.southwest.com/html/southwest-difference/southwest-citizenship/environmental-initiatives/  Based on the premise that knowledge is power- this idea is another avenue to inform and persuade travelers to mitigate their carbon footprint. According to a New York Times article- for many- air travel is most serious environmental sin. One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates a warming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person. The average American generates about 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year. How would people's behavior change if they were told at the beginning of their flight the direct consequences of their travel? Let's give passengers actionable ways to neutralize their negative environmental impact. ((http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html?_r=0). )  As a result of this thought exercise- I'm going to bring my own reusable water bottle during my travels and not use the plastic cups. Since Southwest airlines seem to be on the vanguard of green airlines- writing a letter to request a featured green presentation on flights may be the place to start.  I would love the OpenIDEO community to evaluate my idea keeping in mind their own travel experiences and whether or not it's realistic for passengers to modify their expectations and behavior.How can we encourage airlines to stop using plastic cups and switch to compostable ones? Do we really need the napkins or stirrers. Could they be made available only by request?  My post doesn't mention a specific type of energy  An Individual ,0,0
 The idea will introduce interactive activities into existing community parks and gardens- to demonstrate the capabilities of a variety of renewable energies. Community parks are a great way to showcase different types of renewable energies- demonstrate feasibility- and exhibit practical uses for replacing fossil fuel-based technologies.  This could benefit any community- however the ideal technologies will differ by region. For example- in Chicago you will want to have more of your lamps to be wind powered- but in Arizona- you will want to have more solar powered lamps. If the park is near running water- hydraulic energy will also be incorporated into the plan. The community will be motivated to participate in this so asto feel like they are making an impact on their local environment. Creating a sense of stewardship at the park will be key to this so that community members will feel invested in the park and want to help preserve their environment by decreasing their carbon footprint.This idea addresses all age groups through different technologies. The education level would require literacy as the technologies will be accompanied by small plaques which explain the technologies and address any FAQs.  My idea will increase community education surrounding renewable energies and climate change and also will familiarize the community with a variety of renewable energies. It will demonstrate that renewables are approachable- cost-effective- and feasible in all regions. The end goal will be to convince citizens to incorporate these or similar technologies in their homes. At the front of the park there will be an informational center which will help home owners learn how they can easily adopt similar technologies in their own homes. This pilot will also inspire similar parks to pop up around the world and encourage schools to start similar projects.  The solar ovens and dehydrators could be easily implemented in almost any community garden or urban park for testing. The educational plaques would be good to test in community gardens and public areas where solar street lamps have already been implemented to gage what FAQ questions there are and to evaluate the interest level of the community in these technologies.  I would love to hear other ideas and suggestions on how to decrease the carbon footprint of the park. My background tends to be more community organization based and I would love to hear from users with business-centric background about their ideas for how to creatively introduce a revenue stream into the project and how to efficiently scale this to several communities.

 There's a huge disconnect when it comes to seeing the hard facts of the energy issues versus feeling emotionally compelled to do it.It is very apparent in the city populace where we often get blended into our surroundings and get grouped with the people around us.we have no problems understanding the figures or statistics given to us by advocate groups of renewable energy. However there is this lack of identity about who the believers really are.Figuring out the philosophy behind advocating for renewable energy- and also creating a culture for those who believe in it helps them to feel a stronger sense of identity and might better help call more to action.  all communities will probably benefit from this. Cleaner energy sources clearly benefit us in all ways. It's just the lack of initiative to change. That is what we must tackle- if an ideology is nailed down- it's influence will be passed on.  Honestly it might not create positive change rapidly- but gradual change is often the most contagious one.talking about specifics- this idea is not about a revolutionary product or a great media campaign. Those can come later- after believers of renewable energy go back to the drawing board and define who they are- and realize their philosophy.After that let it guide them and let their actions be consistent. This gains trust- and rallies like minded individuals therefore creating a community. As the community grows- the idea spreads- and there is more ability to take action.  I would first question children- especially one growing up in cities- what do they feel towards this issue. What motivates them to take action and why would they want to adopt renewable energy sources. The children are the ones that would be the most honest about this issue- they are the ones we need to listen to. Children growing up in cities often lose their empathy after spending time in system that value efficiency and speed. This in turn created selfishness and even if they adopt cleaner energy sources- there is no emotional reward because they have made it all about themselves.  No specific hard or technical skills- I would love to brainstorm and have our ideas bounce of one another. What I have is still too raw to be brought to the world.

 This Solar home system is for developing countries - 606 million people just in Africa and over millionspeopleinAsia are living without power - are using paraffin and candles to get light during dark hours. We all know paraffin and candles are hazardous means of light both fumes contaminationand higher risk of fire in highly flammable wooden houses causing over 550-000 death rate justof severe burn cases and many die with smoke contaminations with survivors left with asthma conditions.People cannot afford to buy energy or terrain does not allow to get them electricity so most of people get local government grants or income restrictions let them afford 3/4 USD per week for fuel-  this unique pay as you go system enables the customer to buy credits of same budget as paraffin or candles ie 3/4 USD per week and buy credit to top up the power box with small keypad provided with this system and when cost of system is paid over period of time this system unlocks its selfcustomer becomes owner of the SHS- will not require any more credits to top up the system. It will work as normal solar powered household. This will be very effective for NGOs - IFC etc who either want to recycle their funds for other development programmes after 12-18 months or private businesses who will sell this system on slightly higher rate and make profits in 12-18 months.  This idea will positively help communities living in developing countries to move from unhealthily and hazardous means to clean and safe energy.  We have potential pipeline for next year- as lead time on this product is 3 months from order date.  I would like to thank you OpenIDEO to give us opportunity to spread our word to let people know there is option of clean energy for developing countries. I would request members to please ask questions and give suggestions as how could we improve our product and contact us if they need our help in dealerships etc. We invite NGO to contact us for our specials deals. I would like to request Natalie to be part of our team on open ideo forum and later if interested to work with us inSoutern America Region.( subject to formal approval of Board of Directors).

 Most highly populated cities have aging infrastructure systems for water distribution. It is no secret that they will require replacement soon. If we incorporate and leverage sophisticated hydropower technology into the design- we not only renew reliable water supplies to the masses- but also repurposes the flow of water as a generated energy. By appropriately pressuring and re-circulating the water through properly positioned turbines- substantial amounts of energy can be created- stored and/or distributed. By leveraging the same turbine technology in river-based communities - the generated energy can off-set existing power needs and encourage the incorporation and utilization of electric-powered public and private transportation.  Initially- this idea will benefit larger- water based metropolitan areas (and their supported suburbs). As the idea based improvements to infrastructure are implemented- the benefits will be realized by all. The main players include the general population (they must understand and leverage their political representation)- energy regulators and providers- engineering and design firms- and local/national/global governments.  This idea creates greater- affordable access to electricity. This not only increases the demand for the power source- but also a demand for the skill-set needed to facilitate its usage and knowledge of its powered products (vehicles- appliances- etc.). Academic curriculum will adjust to meet the demands of this expanded market of consumers and employers.  The first experiment would be the design and placement of a sample turbine based generator to be placed in both the Detroit River and Savannah River would be idea. Each would be fitted with dashboard to determine how much power was generated and potentially stored. The second experiment would be the design and placement of a pressurized recirculation system in a neighborhood subdivision or apartment complex. The overall system would record metrics of energy generated and potentially captured.  I would love to hear from engineers- energy regulation gurus- current and past power plant workers- and anyone else with insights on this perspective. I also would love to hear from those that may not agree with this approach- as their perspective is just as valuable.  A type of energy not listed  An Individual ,0,0

 Our Idea is to leverage existent (international) relationships in P2P lending for renewable energy.On the EnergyLend platform- we connect RE Social Enterprises/NGOs- RE Providers- and Individuals who want to have RE-to lenders around the world.On EnergyLend the platform- organizations can start an energy project for themselves and also RECOMMEND potential renewable energy users to EnergyLend.The same goes for Renewable Energy Providers and Individuals: RE providers can start a lending project for themselves- or recommend their potential clients to EnergyLend.We EMBRACE and EMPOWER relationships built around renewable energy.  Where to Pilot?The long-term goal of EnergyLend is to connect lenders and borrowers internationally- but we feel it is probably easier to pilot the project in an area where RE and RE communities are mature. So far- we are still reaching out to different organizations and professionals to seek the best place to start.With the limited time- we are not sure if we will decide on one before the refinement deadline! But we will follow up and make sure we start at the right place!We believe the pilot place will be determined by where the all sectors are most mature and ready for a re-organization of their resources and a display to the lenders.  •It connects the local to the global. •It has a focus on communal renewable energy facilitation and entrepreneurship. •It will benefit communities in every corner of the world- as long as they havegood infrastructure of mobile/online payment.  Any relevant idea is welcome. Do you know people doing this already? Would you recommend some green financial products out there?Would you like to connect us to professionals you know that may help with this project? How do you think we can find our lenders and borrowers? Do you have any idea how to collaborate with traditional finance and to innovate the present micro-finance?

 Taxis based on Solar energy- Biofuels and Kinetic energy!Two complementary approaches: (1) creating retrofitting kit for existing vehicles (tuk-tuks- taxis and buses); and (2) designing brand new green taxis.  [updated 2/3/15] Commuters have to use vehicles that run on fossil fuels. The only green alternatives are to walk or to ride a bike- but these are not always viable alternatives. With the Green Taxis- commuters have the possibility of using an environmentally friendly and convenient vehicle. It also allows drivers to make a low investment to improve their vehicle- saving on variable costs and attracting new customers. Big cities would benefit the most from this idea- since: 1) would be easier to get veggie oil waste and biofuel; 2) there is a high demand for transportation; 3) these green taxis are much smaller than cars (useful when there is high traffic); 4) tourists will seek will see it as a novel idea.  [updated 2/3/15]The Green Taxis empower people to make choices by themselves. On the one hand- taxi drivers have the possibility of choosing the biofuel they prefer and combine it with other methods (solar and kinetic). The retrofit kit gives them the power to build their own green taxi- buses and tuk-tuks. On the other hand- users have the power choose how commute greenly. This idea helps the whole community transit into renewables since it offers each player incentives to use the product (drivers reduce their variable costs and users breath less pollution).  [updated 2/3/15] The Retrofit Kit is very tangible and can be quickly tested and proven on a small scale whether it has potential to be replicated in other communities. A prototype could be made easily since every part of it already exists: it would be just attaching solar panels to a bus or black receptacle panels to a Motorized diesel bicycle. Using biofuels such as veggie oil has already been proved to work on diesel engines. These kits are both doable and actionable. On the other end- the Green Taxis require more analysis and investment- hence the idea is to find a partner. The lightweight prototype can be made by combining the hybrid motor to the solar panel and the bicycle pedals to combine the energy generation.  Experts in car engines and mechanics.

 With the advent of the smartphone- I had a really cool opportunity to witness several health apps come to life over the past few years. Combined with technologies such as smart wrist bands- watches- and other wearable technologies- these apps have helped people lose weight- train better- become more competitive- eat better- and overall improve their health. Apps like Strava allow for spontaneous communities to develop- and then compete. You can post record times of bike rides on certain locations. Other apps allow one to share what food they ate- and allow friends to comment on these actions-- encourage healthy decisions- and discourage unhealthy ones. Imagine if we had an app that allowed for communities to track energy usage- and compete.  This idea benefits any community that wants to start saving energy using connected devices. The main players would probably be Gen Y'ers who are always on their devices and are pretty competitive. The main players in this case would mostly be members who begin using SmarTraq and share their usage data in order to help a larger community gain a better understanding of energy usage and then take action to reduce their usage.  By having a better understanding of how we use energy- we can begin making decisions on how to use less energy and also be more informed as to what kinds of renewables would be appropriate for a particular community. But using ramification- those who were purchasing or using energy from renewable sources- would have that added to their score- so this would be incentive for others to want to compete and try to lower their usage score- and maybe take action to purchase renewable energy in some way.  Developing a prototype app and using it within a local community could work. It would require manual input to be a lightweight experiment- but it could work and give a good understanding as to whether or not the concept would work.  Anyone with experience in app development or energy sharing would be very helpful to help take this idea further. I am open to any suggestions- but ultimately working with people who have had experience in gamification- app development- and energy monitoring or smart homes/ connected homes.

 What if there was an accessory benefit to going to the gym? What if a gym- could not only work as a place for you to become healthier- but it also made the environment healthier? The Power Plant...Gym is a concept that uses the kinetic energy often produced by people working out and turns it into electric energy. This power could then be used to run the facility. Excess energy could be exported to the grid- used locally on a microgrid- or maybe used to clean water or air in the near vicinity. More importantly- the gym would function as a way to get people talking about renewable energy and the environment. People already doing this...http://www.resourcefitness.net/http://www.thegreenmicrogym.com/  This could benefit any community anywhere- whether this becomes the central generator of power for an area without power or whether it becomes just a performance art piece for a place with power.  It would help the community of workout enthusiasts reach outward while still working inward (i.e. getting healthy).  I could try and do a senior/ junior design project with local universities to have students create concepts and mockups.  model prototyping of feasible- group-based exercise equipment- would help people to better conceptualize what possible benefits exist.

 Sustainability is always seen as an engineering problem when it is in fact a design problem.Sure engineering is part of it- but if a sustainable solution is ugly then it will not have the widest advocacy- nor will it last long and have to be disposed of.It will therefore itself contribute to unnecessary waste.Designers (as well as artists) have established and proven processes and methods for thinking outside the box and increasing the perceived value of a 'thing' or 'experience'.Every sustainable team should include Designers not just as an afterthought - to make it look pretty - but also look at the problem with different eyes and to make for a different interaction with humanity.Human centered design :)  The main players are the engineering companies currently involved in sustainable energy and also the community of designers.They need to come together in a jch deeper relationship than they are presently.As noted above- all communities that have sustainable energy technology in their midst will benefit from this synergy.  If the sustainable energy solution is ugly it will be less widely adopted.Period!  How about a contest among the design community to reimagine what renewable energy could look- sound and feel like?I know this is what OpenIDEO is kind of doing but we really need to engage designers not just sustainability advocates.

 Have a mentor and student funded renewable energy challenge where someone in the field of renewable energy work with environment or engineer students to deploy cost effective solutions. This increase capacity for the students provides a stable partner on the group of the mentor or organization and can be effective first small steps to renewable energy. ***Bonus to the renewable energy challenge could be a development of a mobile app for participants to send in comments and feed back of each project to pick finalist to win some sort of prize.  Cambodia as a least developed country does not have regular access to electricity however is a places were renewable energy could be abundant. Electricity is expensive for the average person to afford and some of the companies have been know to cheat the user to charge them more money. as such if there was constant affordable energy many people especially in rural Cambodia would be happy to use this over regular electricity.  I don't think it would be rapid but progress for a developing country like Cambodia to be able to transition into more sustainable practices especially since population has been on the rise for the past 15 years increasing the need. more over the technical skills to develop innovative technology that goes hand and hand with renewable energy is not available on the scale it needs to be as such to take students who are interested in the field and train them could help in a long term capacity. Along with this the mentors- trainers- teachers- organization etc get an opportunity to develop new partnerships and have access to community based organization etc. This of course is not a rapid or quick solution but in my experience development projects let alone the advancement of new technology requires time to be effective and sustainable.  Go to the university or schools see if there are people who could/ want to participate. also reach out to partners and technical experts to see if they would work with those who are interested.  I really value IDEO human center design approach to solving solution however currently the took kit etc is all in Eng i would like to develop Khmer version and training on this for the participants in this project.as the students develop their solutions to renewable energy I want them to have the opportunity to think about the human context of what they are doing.I also think you have a bigger data based on potential people for students to partner with.

 Bottom up integration: give users reasons to lead the transition into green energies.  This idea benefits a vast number of communities- especially middle class households. Basically- anyone willing to make a relatively small investment to acquire these modular generators in order to save and gain money. Since this approach is centered in the economic benefit of generating green energy- it is not necessary a huge awareness of the benefits of going green.  Because it gives short-term economic reasons for massive adoption of green energy.  We can test if different households are willing to instal solar generator on their roof (or wind trees on their backyard) and connect it to the grid. If they start generating their own energy and understanding the economic benefits of doing so- then it is possible that they won't want to go back to the previous system.  - Better understanding of the technical issues involved - How can different household interact to make the community larger?

 Taking cue from the pop-up retail shops and gourmet food trucks- can we give Energy a cool- hip twist to engage and educate people in public spaces?  The goal would be to replicate similar installation around different communities- by tailoring the information to what’s relevant to each community. Other than the community members themselves who would visit the public spaces and learn about the ‘energy art’- I hope that the project could benefit local artists as well as local governing bodies who can dissipate the relevant information about local energy use i.e. local utilities.  The idea for this exhibit is to really bring what’s nebulous and conceptual about energy and their relationship with energy to the physical space that they can interact with and learn from. I believe that we can empower people to take action by providing access to information that they can understand and act on. For example- along with the installation- we can have a plaque with information about how they can help their communities such as signing a live petition or read about local initiatives.  A big assumption in this idea is that people will voluntarily interact with a public object- just because it is there. I think one meaningful test would be to have a huge sign in a public space indicating some kind of attraction - to see if and how people would react to a public object. Other assumptions to test with the prototype would be how people behave on social media with pieces of public art and whether energy actions or news propagated here would lead to a change - either in thinking or behavior. We would need to figure out what information should be displayed.  I would love to hear feedback from everyone in the OpenIDEO community; what do people think about the idea- how would you interact with such objects- and what would you want to know more? Specifically- I would appreciate input from people with background in urban planning- fine arts- or local governments!  My post doesn't mention a specific type of energy  An Individual ,0,0
 Ignite. Camera. Action!Reality tv (RTV) doesn’t have to be over-the-top drama and emotional exploitation. But rather...RTV can act as a platform to engage awareness and ignite action! It can utilize the spirit of healthy competition to reach positive outcomes- all while simultaneously benefiting multiple stakeholders: communities- competitors- sponsors- networks- etc.  This idea can also be scaled and applied through global television networks creating their own shows that aim for the same outcome of generating rapid transition toward renewable energy. This can be done by following the same show outline and applying it to a different arena- i.e. America’s Got Talent and Britian’s Got Talent.  Initially- this idea will benefit rural Alaska and the other involved stakeholders mentioned earlier. This idea can be scaled and applied to other communities.  This idea could help my own local community lessen our reliance on fuel for heat and electricity. It would also lessen the footprint of living in rural Alaska and make living there more sustainable.  There have already been RTV shows in rural Alaska -- and they are wildly popular. So- this is a good sign that a show is a doable endeavor. Also- because this idea springboards off other successful shows- it shares key traits that viewers seem to gravitate toward.  It would be fun to hash out more details.

 New idea in cooperation with P2P here: https://openideo.com/challenge/renewable-energy/ideas/green-angels-1The idea is create a platform where the most developed communities in clean energy can be the Clean Energy Angels of other less developed communities with the same characteristics.This angel can provide the other community with advise and events to share their expertise in the clean energy goal. This advise can be for the different key players of the communities: Families- technological companies- utilities- etc.  People from all around the world can benefit themselves from this idea. We just need to create a good platform- easy to use- open to all the world.  As the business angels help start-ups to grow- the clean energy angels community will help other communities that aim to be like them.  First of all we could try to create a mockup website and find to representative communities in the world that can be taken as potential users of our platform. After these we should be able to analyse with some measurable parameters how are these two communities doing in their two particular roles. Angel and start-up  We need people expert in: - Rapid prototyping of services.- User research- Knowledge about the different communities in the world to be able to set a list of parameters that will decide if one community is enough similar to another one.- Renewable energies experts to be able to cross references on the demographics- climate and potential renewable energies for the communities.- Building online platforms- with UX/UI knowledgePlease help us refine this idea and make it possible!

 The iShares MSCi ACWI low carbon target Exchange Traded Fund (CRBN)invests money globally within an index of companies that have a low carbon footprint.  This idea can certainly benefit potential and current investors who would value an endorsement from a highly respected design institution.Also- companies that actively make efforts to be globally- socially- and environmentally conscious are prime to benefit.Blackrock- a financial institution that understands the balance between fiduciary standards and social responsibility- will benefit as well.  Investing in such a fund creates an acute awareness of companies that are environmentally responsible and is a step in the right direction in supporting them.  I realized that it would be important to gauge people's 'average' investment knowledge because it would affect the resonance of the idea.From what I've come to gather- there is definitely a disconnect- specifically when it comes to the way the money they put into their 401(K)'s is invested.More input to come!UPDATESeems like there is a lot of confusion when it comes to vocabulary around the financial industry- and understandably so!

 Every piece of waste that is recycled lowers our energy footprint and contributes in its own small way to sustainability.The problem we see everywhere is that the wrong waste is put in the wrong bin.Trash is mixed in with recyclable waste in both trash and recycle bins.The effect of this is that perfectly good recyclable waste is thrown into landfills and also that trash has to be hand sorted out from the recyclable waste at recycling facilities.Riffing on an idea from one of the Creative Business Cup attendees I saw in Copenhagen- how about we design a system that can immediately tell if what you are throwing into a recycle bin is actually recyclable.If it is recyclable you get fanfare and flashing lights.  This has the potential to help a wide swath of our population in many ways.Immediate feedback that they are doing something right and that they are making a difference is the way to start educating people about sustainability.After all... that is how we teach our kids - immediate and positive feedback in a playful way.  Getting the right recyclable trash in the correct bin would help our overall sustainable goals.Yes- it is only a small adjustment- but a small adjustment practiced by millions and millions of people every day can make a big difference.It also will continually make people aware of sustainability and show people that they can make small adjustments that can make a difference.Stepping stones (see Andreanna's idea)  Here is one low tech thing that we can all do toprototype the idea.Next time you are by a recycling bin and someone else puts the correct trash in it- compliment them.See the power of whatpositive reinforcement achieves.

 Use the kinetic energy released by workers in regular office activities to generate alternative energy for office appliances and lighting because offices in large urban centres are big consumers of conventional energy.  The main players are office workers in large urban areas. The community that benefits are the office workers themselves- and the employers who will benefit from reduced electric bills. However- in the short run- there will be capital costs in investing in the special tiles and chairs and keyboards that convert kinetic energy to power electrical equipment.  This idea can help the office community transition to renewables by implicating each office worker personally and directly of their own impact in generating alternative energy. The personal responsibility elementenables a change in attitude for the greater good.  I will look for an 'energy dynamo' bike to see how much power my cycling can generate to operate electrical appliances.  I'd be interested how the OpenIDEO SF team has got on further with their ideas and prototyping as this idea is built on theirs.  A type of energy not listed  An Individual ,0,0
 A world comprised of self-reliant communities empowered to develop and protect their human and natural resources is a resilient- sustainable world. Reconomy works to accomplish this through the innovation of discounting local renewable energy when purchased with SunMoney local currency.  Any community- almost anywhere can benefit.This is a self-help strategy- so it helps most those persons and communities whom help themselves most.  The SunMoney/Reconomy strategy is the same from the most fully-developed- fossil-fuel dependent communities to the poorest of the poor: Local people develop local energy resources for local use -- stimulated by a discount on renewable energy when traded for local credit -- which provides employment- credit- energy and a global network of mutual support at all phases of development.We have sample pilot designs with cost-benefit analyses available online for both developed and emerging communities.  If we were to launch a pilot today- we'd return to India because this is where we've concentrated research and identified the most promising sites to test the core strategy at the lowest start-up costs- in the poorest circumstances- where development matters most.  We're looking to share all of this work in an open-knowledge- open-source manner- to hear constructive criticism- and gather collaborators - especially persons who share our pay-forward approach to solutions. After a decade of discussion with interested persons around the globe- we tried an experiment in 2013 to see if we could find 1000 persons to sign a pledge to help- and we succeeded- with more than 300 persons also committing to pay-forward by finding two or more persons to sign the same pledge. So this can probably go ahead soon with a little seed funding- or perhaps just local elbow grease.Everyone everywhere is invited to help- and anyone almost anywhere can be first to launch in their own community.

 There are really 3 issues that make renewable energy adoption difficult.Why don't we specifically tackle those 3 issues in a variety of ways?Anything not tackling these 3 issues is a misuse of resources.Cost is the first problem...a. Utilities- they have to provide power as cheaply as possible- by law.This hamstrings them.If we volunteered to pay more- better supported politics that required Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards (RPS)- and used environmental funding dollars to collaborate instead of fighting- we'd get further.b. Technology CAPEX-renewable implementation is already coming down- so we just gotta keep doing what we are doing and they will keep getting cheaper.to increase this rate- we just need more.  The main players are utilities and customers.This applies to place where energy is a regulated market.  Removing the number 1 barrier to implementation will make it more likely that people start to get it done.  Ideally- finding a neighborhood willing to be a test case for a renewable fee pool might work.Here in the south though- that might be hard to find.

 Festivals around the world create instant temporary communities from the ground. Using them as test site and platform for integration of community wide energy solutions can yeild fast results appliable for real life communities- as solutions can be integrated in the building process. Our idea is that an international platform is needed- that can speed up the spread of viable solutions tested and demonstrate at festivals across the world. Additionally- the platform could act as agent for inspiring other festival to adopt an experimental and sustainable framework. The platform could be ranging from a website to an annual conference on community sustainability through festivals.  All types of communities- because the solutions found to be efficient in a festival setting is likely to be retrofitted to permanent communities. However- specially refugee camps and third world communities can benifit from experiences gained in a festival setting- as these communities are relativly low power comsumers which most local solutions are better equiped to deal with compared to industrial communities.  As Roskilde Festival also acts as a show case for sustainable solutions- audiences and stakeholders are able to see solutions in action on a community wide scale. Additionally- stakeholders can test their own gear for futhere implementation in permenant communities.  We are already conduction a wide range of experiments and solutions in colaboration with universities and companies. However the main challenge for the current time is to convey the experiences to a wider audience and establish solid collaboration ties.  I am not sure jet.

 Wind and solar power are now so cheap in many regions that sometimes what’s holding renewables back isn’t cost: it’s communication. We propose encouraging the key players—the community- utility- and renewable power plant—to work with each other to make the best use out of the renewable power sources we already have. Today- utilities force wind and solar plants to waste up to 16% of their output- because renewable electricity production changes unpredictably whenever the weather does. If the community could join the conversation whenever this waste occurred- then any business or homeowner could help soak up the surplus renewable energy in their local “windshed-” offsetting the use of fossil fuel power.  The “windshed” idea has the most benefit for areas that meet three conditions: a large number of renewable power installations- with the potential for more; a reactionary utility that’s struggling to cope with the clean energy economy; and a community that’s heavily invested (emotionally and/or financially) in local renewable energy. Such is the situation in many parts of Hawaii- where community-supported solar power often goes to waste- or in many parts of Vermont and Washington State- where community-supported wind power often goes to waste. As to the players:· It benefits the wind farm- because it gives them more business and helps them compete with fossil fuels.· It benefits any homeowner- institution- and municipality that wants to support renewable energy or meet sustainability targets.· It benefits the utility- because it helps them balance the power grid and cut costs.· And by avoiding costlier energy sources- it would lower the price of electricity in the area- benefitting everyone- especially low-income people and public institutions with tight budgets.  Every time anyone in the community used extra electricity when there is a local renewables surplus- that energy would come from clean power. Of course the most direct benefit would be if individuals and institutions could use power then and not at other times. In that case- they’d be directly shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy right away. And that speed is important! Most of the time- the only way to use more renewable energy is to build more renewable plants—a slow and expensive process. But excess renewable power can be available instantly. In the long run- any surplus renewable power that gets soaked up helps renewable power plants compete with traditional fossil fuel plants by earning more revenue. Moreover- it not only helps the utilities balance the power grid- it helps them do it in a way that makes renewables and communities the solution- not a “problem” for them to try to fight. Essentially- a community that made these data public would be letting anyone who wanted to “vote” for wind. By literally taking control of where their energy comes from- it would also help people rethink their own role in energy and climate.  · Ask the operator of your local wind farm how often they are asked to waste power. Lots of curtailment = lots of potential savings.· Call the back office at your local utility and ask if they would be willing to share these data with the community. A utility that’s open to creative solutions will be more collaborative. Ask other community members if they support the idea- and tell the utility how many community members are on your side.· Gather a team to attend a city council meeting and demonstrate your support for this idea to your representatives. If the utility is resistant- pressure from lawmakers or the community at large can convince the utility to cooperate.· Ask the facility manager at a local business- school- or other public building about how they use their electricity. Appliances that are flexible about when they get used—like smart thermostats- electric water heaters- walk-in fridges at restaurants- or electric cars—are the easiest to shift to cleaner times.· Survey your friends and community members to ask if they would sign up for an app that alerts them when excess renewable energy is available from the grid. If you are a coder (or know one)- write an prototype app using sample data. Some data is already available at http://api.WattTime.org/.  · Does anyone live in a community where this information already is public who can talk about their experience?· Does anyone work with a community-owned wind farm (like Kingdom Community Wind in Vermont) which might be willing to share its own information without a utility?· Does anyone at a utility have access to these data (about “curtailment”)?· Does anyone have experience working with local governments to advance innovative clean energy policies?

 To fortify the notion of holistic renewable energy solutions. I wish to contribute the idea to establish Solar operating centers run by councils / local authorities in each residential areas especially in poor countries in Africa /Asia. The idea is to give an option for people usingfossil fuels particularly areas where communities use firewood to have alternate source.The community will use the center to prepare food paying small charge like shared laundry centers. In Somalia cutting trees not only damaged environment - but likewise damaged food security of the nomadic due to recurrent droughts Esatblishing shared solar centres run by local may accelerate transition from our current reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energy  This will benefit the whole community at large and particularly those who use Fossil Energy . It will save time and likewise will amplify as other energy sources to reduce environmental degradation and emission of co. The key players are the local authorities - health supervisors and other environmental scientific researchers and energy suppliers who will go further to test whether this could extended to homes. The idea is to see if develop into pipeline energy where each area could be supplied at certain times of the day  This idea definitely will help poor people currently using Firewood in Africa and Asia who don't have access to other sources of energy. And if tested it will definitively lift a great burden on the environment. As briefly mentioned above- In Somalia and like countries majority of population in the rural areas depend upon Firewood for all food preparation as well as lighting. You will find a big local restaurant using big wooden stacks of firewood or charcoal which is running as a fire for the whole to prepare simpler things like tea or coffee.  I am willing to try a smaller or medium size- solar dishes to distribute it to 300 or more villages which currently depend on firewood and who are willing to use - Solar energy because in addition to diminishing environmental degradation and cutting trees which adversely reduced the rate of rainfall. The communities are willing to change and try solar energy to minimize the fire damage liability which is 80% likely to occur on daily basis.The revenue or proceeds collected will go back to the community to maintain the centers and also to be used for other communal activities like purification of water sources by digging more wells.  I welcome academicians and solar energy experts as well as community at large to hone the idea with me taking into consideration that cutting in Somalia has become so flourishing business and unfortunately terrorist and self appointed war lords have made millions of dollars through charcoal business by selling charcoal at Middle-east. Assisting these small towns and villages with centralized solar cooking dishes will likewise discourage the population to refrain from cutting because that will give them another source or option to new sources of energy.

 Groundbreaking work has established the viability of a world powered by 100-percent-renewable energy using existing technologies. BUT no implementation pathway currently exists.This is a modular community-energy-system design- which tackles multiple problems associated with integrating distributed-renewable-energy production. It addresses these problems by changing the scale of the energy system from distant centralized power production to local energy production- use- and management. It provides a viable pathway for the construction of scalable 100-percent renewable-energy systems. Additionally it creates a new model that can integrate the best community-based renewable-energy innovation in an effort to make new ideas scalable.  [Update 7 Feb 2015] The first round of implementation in Santa Barbara County will benefit the following stakeholders:1) Santa Barabara residents - residents of Santa Barbara have been experiencing blackouts because of an unreliable power system. The business community is up in arms about it and they are pushing for a real solution.The improvement of the distribution grid by Edison is a perfect opportunity to rebuild it correctly to enable two-way power flow. Our design for more locally produced energy will give residents and local businesses the reliability they need now and the resilience they need should a major outage occur. Edison has warned in their own documents of the major risks facing Santa Barbara County because of the County's position at the end of the transmission grid and the lack of backup transmission should the existing (aging) wires go down in a storm or fire.A rollout of renewables for all county and city buildings will save residents money immediately - a recent report from the Solar Foundation found that almost every K-12 school in the county would benefit from solar and would immediately save money on power. Only four schools currently have solar installed.2) University of California- Santa Barbara - the UC Regents have set a commendable sustainability goal forevery campus to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. UCSB can combine their existing efforts with our system design to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity- not just for their campus- but in support of a wider community effort. The Clean Energy Moonshot pilot in Santa Barbara would support the campus's efforts as well- giving their project wider geographic boundaries and more diverse distributed generation opportunities- including a potential brown-gas-powered fuel cell from a nearby wastewater treatment plant.3) Local economy - construction and maintenance jobs throughout the local area will increase and create an economic multiplier effect. Local energy production will keep the community's capital WITHIN the community - a key economic sustainability metric. Recapturing some of the money spent on energy (electricity and eventually transportation dollars via EVs and fuel-cell-powered EVs) will localize capital flows and support a thriving green business sector. Sponsorship and branding opportunities for local businesses who embrace the microgrid will help to change business consciousness locally. The City of Santa Barbara and surrounding communities already have a thriving tourism industry. This green business opportunity can serve as a unique attraction for visitors and conferences. [/End Update 7 Feb 2015]= This system is a huge economic explosion waiting to happen. Local energy systems will benefit communities at every level.Foreseeable Benefits of Local Energy Production:-Local energy systems create good jobs! Construction- maintenance- and management jobs become community-based- keeping business activity and capital flows in the service area.-Real Estate owners can become energy self-sufficient or even local energy exporters! With small power plants on their roof- these properties harness their own energy and sell it into local markets.-Individual customers can share in cost savings and efficiencies - renewable energy unlocks abundance because unlike the consumption of scarce resources like oil and gas- the price of renewable energy systems continues to go down as more are deployed- leading to lower prices for electricity - just look at wind!-Businesses can market their facilities and products as carbon neutral - as global consciousness shifts to the climate emergency- consumers will value products that don't heat the planet. This is an example of the confluence of values and marketing; businesses can stand for something critical to the planet (lowering ghgs) while also selling services and products to make a profit.-International finance can win as well - there are Trillions (yes with a T) of dollars looking for good investment opportunities in the private capital markets. This system- if properly designed- is modular- scalable- and creates a standardized investment opportunity for huge pools of cash which are currently hunting a safe place to invest. The advantages of socially responsible investing are becoming more and more clear- this is the ultimate socially responsible investment because it could help to prevent the climate disaster.- State- National- and Global benefits - the first-movers who develop and help deploy these technologies will give birth to entire new industries. The production of advanced renewable energy systems- software- new vehicles- and new business models- will all become unprecedented opportunities for new business activity. These technologies will drop in price as they scale and will be appropriate solutions for developing countries as well- brining billions of new people literally into the light and giving them new opportunities for development.  Changing the scale away from huge centralized power to community controlled creates changes the game for innovation- community action- and for reducing our impact on the planet.Currently distributed renewable energy production is limited by policy and by the state of the electricity infrastructure. Communities need a NEW SYSTEM to be able to fully deploy all of the brilliant energy production- storage- and management technologies that currently exist.[Update 7 Feb 2015] This system change will let any social entrepreneur within the service area build an energy business and immediately participate in the renewable energy revolution.The Community Microgrid becomes the foundation upon which the fully integrated- optimized- distributed- and resilient community power system can be built. It's the killer app that allows the billions of brilliant people and millions of excellent energy innovations to actually work.  The initial work done by the Clean Coalition- which can be replicated in any community- can identify the low hanging fruit- for the development of a microgrid. This analysis demonstrates the location for the deployment of solar pv and some additional grid improvements to achieve significant levels of renewable energy without a significant overhaul. This analysis can demonstrate the viability of this idea anywhere- very quickly.We are working to create a Community Microgrid with Fuel Cell power plants in Santa Barbara- California- which is hanging by a thread to the transmission grid and experiences electricity disruptions on a regular basis. Helping to develop this system (which would be far bigger and more complex than Hunters Point) would prove the viability of the model. Smaller scale systems could be rolled out across college campuses and at hospitals along the way. These smaller systems may not have the scale needed to achieve 100 percent renewable energy but it's worth a try and will be a net positive in any case.  We would like to spread this concept far and wide. Identifying communities that are ready for an all-out push for renewable- reliable- resilient power systems and connecting them with me would be very helpful.Additionally my organization- which has been developing this concept- is in need of funding to support our championing of this project. We want to continue to develop and spread this idea but we're only going to be able to do so with the financial support and partnership of individuals- companies- and philanthropic organizations who share this vision for a renewable energy future.[Updated 7 Feb 2015] Our top priority is implementing this model in Santa Barbara County to work with all stakeholders and create a scalable model that solves current reliability problems in Santa Barbara County and demonstrates the pathway to implementation for other counties. We are designing a fundraising campaign to raise funding for the first two years of this project.THIS IS THE PATHWAY! Now we need support to make it a reality.

 Design a cheap little solar panel device no more complicated than a solar powered calculator that will sit on a south facing window sill and tell you how much energy you could be saving if you had installed solar panels on your roof.It could also have additional modules that could assess wind & geothermal.It could connect through WiFi to house internet and have an associated Smartphone App that could give you real time running data and allow you to configure it for your particular situation.This would provide a stepping stone to assessing the cost savings associated with installing renewable energy devices.It would also allow for collection of big data from everyone that uses it to allow for accurate regional solar energy mapping.  This is really targeted at the community of people who would consider solar panels (and wind/geothermal) but are unsure of their benefit in their actual home situation.This could be a free evaluation kit so the Solar Panel Company (renewable energy compony) would have to underwrite the cost (How about it SolarCity?)In return the company would have started a continuing relationship with a potential customer and be able to use the start to offer advice throughout that relationship.Being a free kit the threshold for homeowner implementation is drastically reduced.It would also have the potential to be like scratching an itch - constantly checking it.Neighbors could get involved and compare their savings.There could be competitions between neighbors to enhance the engagement with the Solar Company.  This really targets one of the necessary steps in the journey to installing solar panels and wind and or geothermal collection.Every step is important.See Stepping Stones by Andreanna.  If a Renewable Energy Company was amenable...we could easily put up a landing page that would offer the kit and see who and how many would sign up for it.  The workings of the kit and the App is beyond my current ability so someone would need to undertake this aspect.The Renewable Energy Company would also need to be aboard.Once again... this is a brainstorming idea so jump in and make it better :)  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0

 In simple terms- this idea proposes to combine the local government and crowdfunding to support the most affordable renewable energy designs that fit the qualifications. Cost and scalability are among the greatest barriers to renewable energy use. For example- while solar and wind have the greatest potential to meet our energy demand- most projections predict capital costs of 1000-1400 $/kW for solar PV and 750-1000 $/kW for wind onshore in 2050 (Luderer et al.). Collaborative competition will not only provide funding for such renewable projects- but also encourage innovations toward affordability and scalability. The two sketches below portray the idea.  This idea can benefit almost any community with a website capable of processing fundings and design ideas. The main players are the municipality- the individuals/groups participating in crowdfunding- and the individuals/groups participating in design.  The idea allows the community to generate funding as well as innovative ideas in a practical and collaborative way.  Set up a simple website page with a few hypothetical projects.  I would love to learn more about the municipalities. For example- how much knowledge do they have regarding renewable energies- how much resources do they usually have- incentives etc.  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 Instead of relying on huge diesel trucks to pick up households' trash and bring it to the dump- create an organization that employs youth to collect compost on bicycles and transport the material to a tower-sized decomposer. This way- the impact is two-fold: not only will there be a positive outlet for teenagers and a means of earning an income (the respective community would use money saved from transporting via trucks to pay a small stipend to participants)- but there will also be a way to harness food waste into a renewable energy source. ,0,0
 Consider- for a second- the personal computer. People didn’t own computers until they were affordable AND small enough AND friendly enough to easily introduce into our everyday lives. Then we saw a technology revolution...when the tools were easily within reach!The idea here is to seek out tools that are easily within reach. To layout stepping-stones- big and small.The first stepping stone needs to be a friendly first step ! One simple idea that could quickly get the ball rolling would be a design/sustainability framework or a toolkit (similar to IDEO’s HCD Toolkit) that provides a gateway to energy transition- both for municipal users and residential users.  This idea benefits communities interested in learning- discussing- exploring and implementing renewable energy.  Talking about the steps needed can help us find which steps are best fitted to our own community as we engage in our own renewable energy transformation. There are different and widely varied solutions for each unique circumstance. We need some kind of avenue/toolkit/framework- formatted in a friendly and simple way- where people can go to find solutions -- stepping stones -- that are right for their situation.

 Per Scientifican American:[S]olutions cited in the study include white roofs that reflect more sunlight back to space or hybrid roofs that combine aspects of white and green- or planted- roofs. A large enough number of such roofs could completely offset warming due to urban expansion and even offset a percentage of future greenhouse warming over large regional scales- says sustainability scientist Matei Georgescu at Arizona State University- who lead the research.http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cool-roofs-might-be-enough-to-save-cities-from-climate-overheating/  A combination of various types of renewable energy  A Group Brainstorm ,0,0
 In this study- we aim to develop a prefabricated housing concept- named ENERCUBE- which combines innovative architecture and energy generation through the integration of solar panels. We want to bring contemporary design – an aspect that is typically ignored - to affordable housing in order to provide an improved living environment for families up to five people. Due to its modular construction- ENERCUBE is low cost and can be assembled fast by unskilled labor. Effectively- our concept innovates along two dimensions: it reinvents the design of housing units for the underprivileged and transforms the business model for affordable housing through solar energy production.  1.6 Billion people around the world live in inadequate housing conditions and as a result struggle with illness- insufficient education and crime. Despite the positive impact of micro-finance- the number of people in substandard housing is increasing because of demographics trends such as continued urbanization and growing wealth disparity. If these trends are not managed- the United Nations projects the number will grow to 3 billion - 40 percent of the total population - by 2030. In order to make a meaningful impact on the global issue of inadequate housing- new and disruptive business concepts are needed. [update 02/06/2015] Our target group is underprivileged communities whose members suffer from unemployment- lack of education- poverty- homelessness- discrimination etc. Communities that above all are in need of a holistic support- a new vision for their future not reduced to the form offinancial aid. The Enercube addresses its community needs in a direct way providing proper housing and proper sanitation - and in a more indirect way forging the path to this new shared vision. The end-user experience will be a feeling of comfort and safety - a safe haven for children to grow and be able to play and do their homework.STAKEHOLDERSThe Government needs to allocate land for the project and issue individual leases for at least 200 plots. The future residents will be subsidized partially by government funds but will also be burdened with a mortgage issued by private investors at a South African Bank with an interest rate plus adequate risk spreads. The residents will only be able to gradually pay off the mortgage when a steady agreement has been reached with the utility company- in our case probably ESKOM- for a 20 year purchase agreement on a fixed rate (inflation included).  [update 02/06/2015]By combining energy generation and housing- we can essentially tackle 2 main problems at once and force increased adoption of solar panels. The Enercube proposition is aiming towards a new vision - a community that embraces its future in connection to renewable energy - a solar community that could foster to its members a whole-life approach to sustainability.  It is quite impossible to test this product in the context of a developed country. Therefore- we selected South Africa as the benchmark location to test the commercial viability of our business model (severe housing issues & high solar radiation) [update 02/06/2015]Our research so far has been of academic nature- gathering information on geography- culture- typical household structure- demographics- education- health- employment and unemployment- access to basic services- crime- migration patterns etc. We have also studied surveys on existing types of housing- on models of financing and of course the literature around affordable housing design as a whole and for South Africa in particular. Conducting on-site research by contacting some potential end-users is very hard at this point purely because of physical distance. We acknowledge the need to engage directly with the community to allow the project to take a more specific form and are willing to do so in the near future.  [update 02/06/2015]The input we are extracting from the Renewable Energy Challenge has already been invaluable for the Enercube Project. The transition to Renewable Energy can only come through the collaboration of many; governments- the private sector- communities and individuals. The OpenIDEO community offers the mold where such collaboration can take shape. We are keen to see the extents to which already among the 20 groups selected for the Refinement Phase ( but also with many more that did not make it to that phase) a strong coalition of ideas and forces could be established. With Benjamin Kimmich and Avava Systems to strengthen the design of our prototype- with Eden Fulland Jake Schual-Berke to make our PV systems more efficient through the course of the day- with Simon Heereman and Natalie Lake to help us incorporate ingenious low-cost waste-management systems in our prototype- with Ramiro Sanchez Caballero and the PowerGym team to imagine small technological breakthroughs that could revolutionize the user-experience- with the Energy Pop-Up team and Nathan Lucy's team to guide us on how to best approach communities- with Malachi to think how we can go beyond the house itself and help community members builda new identity- with Tosh Szatow- Anna Schneider and Gavin McCormick to expand our funding possibilities and broaden our understanding of how ideas can come to life.

 So many things can be encouraged and facilitated by social networks. One of these could be the renewable energy! A social network could allow:- people to rapidly share information and tips for energy saving (best energy retailer- latest technologies- ;- people living in the same area to organize themselves for car pooling or solar panel installation;- interested people to propose/take part into sustainable projects.All these topics could be efficiently managed and organized in a social network- pushing the rapid adoption of renewable energy!!!

 This idea capitalizes on the most ubiqutous distribution network in Haiti - Digicel Top Up merchants. To add more minutes to their mobile phones- Haitians visit roaming vendors sometimes as much as twice a week. These merchants present a preexisting network for spreading the word- selling- and distributing small-scale solar devices. The same customers who visit these vendors to add minutes naturally need means by which to charge their cell phone among other essential needs. We would start by selecting 20 merchants from across the Port-au-Prince urban area as a pilot to test success in selling the solar devices. These merchants would be trained in the selling of 3 different solar products which serve the needs of diverse clients.  I like the idea of choosing three different solar energy products catering to various needs because the idea spans diverse users. The Need Level 1 product might be most useful for young people and students- but is really relevant to all age groups. The Need Level 2 product is probably most beneficial to women and food vendors. The Need Level 3 product is probably only obtainable byadults who have attended college and are in the middle-to-upper class income bracket.Main players include Digicel- the solar energy product manufacturers- the vendors- and the Digicel community.  The idea is to make a Digicel user feel like adoption of solar energy products is as easy as Topping Up their phones - which is something they do frequently and with ease. This idea streamlines the transition to renewables into an everyday process with which they are already familiar.The almost hiearchael progression of products might allow someone to envision a ladder they can rapidly climb as they simultaneously decrease costs of buying fossil fuels and increase their income. For example- let's say Micheline succeeds at paying off her Level 1 Product. She continues to charge friends and neighbors small rates for charging their phones- and the use of her light after dark allows her to increase efficiency of her small sewing business. The increased profits of her sewing business allow her to eventually buy a solar cookstove which she gives to her mother who is a food vendor. Micheline and her mother begin to envision a day where their increased profits- all beginning from the Level 1 product- allow them to purchase the Level 3 Product for their home.  The landscape of my community is vastly different from that of the Digicel community in the Port-au-Prince area. Americans are less trusting of what they might consider to be an informal vendor. The return for Americans if they purchased the Level 1 Product would be far lower than the return for Haitians.I'll have to think on this more!  *One of the most challenging questions in my mind for the proposal is: what is the incentive for Digicel to rollout these products via their vendors? Does Digicel need to be the primary manufacturer of these products in order to make it viable? *Do the payment plans make sense and seem viable and enforceable? *Am I missing a major essential need beyond charging phones- light for additional study and small business hours- cooking- and eventually solar panels to power homes and medical facilities? *This idea tackles renewable energy rollout in an almost makeshift way- rather than tackling it with a more formally designed infrastructure. Could this hurt formal adoption down the road in any way? *Ideas for designing a distribution network for the solar energy products to the Digicel vendors  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 Storing renewable energy from wind farms- solar panels etc. has a major problem.Most storage technologies are inefficient at best and very wasteful at worst.Large scale batteries that would be used to store the electricity cannot be fully charged before becoming inefficient and can only use about 10% of their power without compromising the amount of recharge cycles before they have to be thrown away and replaced.Even storing the electricity as hydrogen gas using an electrolyzer and large storage tanks is only currently about 38% efficient (although the hydrogen produced could also be used to power sustainable vehicles)We need it find a better way to store that electricity that is 100% efficient and FULLY accessible.  The big idea of re-thinking the energy storage problem will benefit everyone that is on a path to sustainability who uses renewable energy and has to store it.The main players are all the energy grids and the regional weather bureaus- as well as the renewable energy companies.They all need to pool their data to so that the exact size of a self sustaining grid could be calculated.After that- an alliance of the different grids would need to be formed and some kind of payment structure decided upon.Maybe it should even be like what happened with the deregulation of Ma Bell in the USA and other telephone companies leasing parts of the infrastructure.You should be bale to buy your power from anywhere and it just transported to you over the gird.You could specifically only buy renewable energy if you wanted to contribute to its implementation.As you see I need some help fully thinking this through.  With the inefficiency and high cost of storage comes the high cost of renewable energy implementation.This is seen by individuals as the cost of either having to store it themselves or the cost of not being able to sell it back to the grid as they have no way of storing it and using it.If the whole extended grid was balanced and would generate as much as it needs then the price would come down significantly for everyone to implement renewable energy on their home or land.Everybody would be users and also contributors to the energy grid.  Surely there is enough data already out there such that someone could estimate the size of the grid that would allow this to happen and even tell us if it is even possible?This is such a big idea that I don't know how to prototype it in a community.Any suggestions?  What do other people think?  A combination of various types of renewable energy  An Individual ,0,0
 Chile is an emerging economy with an energy grid about to burst itself from overuse. So how can we introduce renewable energies into society?Chile's energy cost is the highest in its region and its solar radiation it is one of the highest making it a great combination for solar energy. Yet if technology was the only variable every single rooftop would have a photovoltaic module installed- still that is not the case. Today the problem is all about two things; education and overlapping energy use with the solar production (day). Giving this particular scenario schools provide a unique and perfect place to start. Their energy use is during the day which overlaps with the production of energy using a PV plant.  This idea was originally thought for  It helps the community to actually build PV plants. Take action.  Metope within administrators of schools.  Solar  An Individual ,0,0
 Cut down energy consumption using the universal language of money.Leaflet should contain the usual list of ways to save energy and cut down bills such as -1/Yearly savings if using energy saving bulbs Vs Incandescent 2/Yearly heating savings if a house attic is insulated and/or walls Vs non insulated 3/Money saved per degree of temperature lowered on the thermostat.4/Money saved by switching appliances off from the mains rather than leaving on standby5/Reduced price on A+++ rated appliances (remove some VAT tax)6/Bonuses for correct recycling (waste price discounts)continued belowSpecial thanks to Alisha Rhagavan for inspiration from her 'Public Energy Consumption measurables'  Benefits everyone who pays a bill or is trying to save money.It would need to be government backed to be completely efficient. Returns would be many years in the making but once a house in energy efficient it stays that way for life so it's a long term govt. investment. In turn- good energy saving habits are passed on from generation to generation.The economy would benefit from the populace having more disposable income and through jobs created from insulation- car sales-weather glaze etc.  Less consumption of energy is good for everyone- even the planet.It means less pollution and reliance on nonrenewable energy production.  It's been done here to a lesser degree. My house in currently insulated thanks to an affordable discount system implemented by the govt.My electricity bill is one third of what it used to be due to a change in habits - turning things fully off- energy saving bulbs- insulation  It'll need a big list of really innovative ideas and I'd appreciate all input in making it as I don't have the time to do it on my own.

 This team prototyped the Green Points system- which enables people to generate electricity and receive a new type of currency for doing every day physical actions- such as using revolving doors and walking on treadmills.  This idea benefits any community that wants to generate their own energy! Any participating community members will also be rewarded with points to purchase local goods. One of the great things about this idea is that any community member can easily become involved. Also- because everyone likes free stuff- there's incentive for everyone to take part.  This idea helps make a transition to reusable energy because everyone has incentive to participate and see how easy and beneficial it is to produce energy.  We could put an Energy Generation Treadmill in public with an explanation of the program and see if people were interested.  What can Green Points be used for (only local goods- only energy-conscious purchases- etc.?)What are other everyday things that could be used to generate energy?

 The solar flux of a solar dish is very powerful.It can melt steel.Solar dishes can also supply communities cheap energy via hot water- steam- chilling- power- and chemicals.Solar dishes are the most efficient type of solar collectors. On those shoulders we made extraordinary breakthroughs in solar dish economics.Dishes will now be much cheaper than fossil fuels. Huge global applications await supply.This is stunningly powerful stuff.  The community is global with endless applications -- displacing firewood for cooking- water supply- community and building heat and chilling- hot water- industrial process steam- electrical power- pumping- brewing and food processing- waste treatment- distillation- district heating----Universities are the most eager early adopters.  Can be readily fabricated with existing commodities for something like $0.15/Watt (thermal).Simple payback is two years without subsidies.Costs continually go down with time and experience.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y366lZE32eghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9rc3fDuxE4  Funding and/or tech transfer.

 Technology is now available for:- highly sophisticated data collection from arrays of sensors-anonymization of data to ensure privacy-linking devices into intelligent networks-optimization of specific operating goals over the networkThe key idea here is that securing privacy will enable communities tonetwork more devices- gather more data- and enable transformative benefits.  Primary target community is residential and small commercial energy users- since large commercial building operators already have a large financial incentive and a host of service providers assisting.Theidea of personal monitoring scales up and down to all energy uses which are influenced by those who see the energy use feedback.Once energy monitoring tools and apps are easily available- you can bet school science teachers will see the opportunity toengage kids of all agesin some measurements as well. If a community dashboard shows statistics for schools and other public buildings [and utility company offices] - so that anyone can review kwh per occupant- energy cost/minute- overnight demand- etc. [and compare with their own private data] we would see energy use drop dramatically- changing the energy marketplace.  Renewables are preferable to fossil fuels- which is going to continue to drive the market. The primary objections now are cost and perceived inability to meet the overall demand. These are directly addressed by public data:-Demand will drop for energy as conservation efforts grown and wasted energy is identified - Prices will drop for fossil fuels for a while- but prices will rise again as market levers are exploited. The big transparent public databaseenvisioned here will reduce that opportunity. -Money people save on ordinary fuels will be first in line to support renewables- either installing generators where demand is low enough- or by purchasing 'green power' -More and more small scale renewables will be deployed when more convenient or economical- especially where costly new power lines would otherwise be required.--Increases in solar production efficiency will continue to be economicalto apply to the infrastructure by layering new panels- and similar upgrading of technologies should be economical with other sources.-  We have a neighborhood list serve for sharing info among about a hundred homes- it offers an opportunity to see who might opt in on a simple survey of energy related issues with display of opinion on a neighborhood GIS.Our local high school is across the street- perhaps the science and engineering and social activism clubs could be engaged to investigate and publish energy related information for the site and its community. Boys and Girls Club for after-school activities is another easily accessible local organization which might be engaged.  This idea incorporates the growing perception that open source data and transparent markets willincrease benefits for all stakeholdersfaster than competitive secretiveness and win/lose transactions. Going beyond the rich talent pool already in this challenge- I searched IDEO team members with keywords 'collaborate- transparent- and market- and hope they all don't mind being invited to weigh in.This idea is manifest already in various markets including the energy market- and it is an open invitation toour OpenIDEO community to identify and connect potential partners. Any piece that can be placed in the jigsaw frame for the product solution will bring us to a full picture. ,0,0
 Often people aren't aware of the scaleof their energy consumption. To begin with if a system could be implemented in public and commercial establishments- where a meter is attached to every light and water source showing your consumption as you use it- it would be hard to shy away from those numbers.  People living in urban areas and cities have the largest consumption of energy and do not realise the impact of their daily living.They have no means to measure their consumption at home and especially outside their home. Home automation and products like nest maybe bringing energy aware at home but public areas are yet to reach there.People from the age group of mid 20s to early 60s- who are graduates would be the prime targets.  Awareness is the first step in bringing transition- if people become aware they would be more keen to adopt renewable energy sources. Currently the environment and energy to most urban city goers is a distant problem they don't entirely wish to identify with.  Currently it is easy to avail data for the overallelectricity and water consumption of a particular establishment- I would try to see if that data could be made visible for all to see and study if people respond to the data seen constantly in front of them.

 I believe that if there are renewable energy conventions that are held every couple of months in each state- it would help for people to hear and learn from others what ideas are successful as well as what ideas are more difficult to complete.  The people who will benefit from this idea are those in which ever state the convention is held.The boundaries are endless.  This idea will help my community to rapidly transition to renewable ways by bringing all of our ideas together so that we can come to the proper resolutions in a quicker time period.  To experiment with this idea in a lightweight manor right now- I would create a convention of my own consisting of people whom I know to see if we can come to a concenciousof when would be a good time to have the first convention  The input or guidance I would need from the OpenIDEO community is of organizations and people that are willing to work together to put together these conventions in there area.

 Many communities exist within very large energy utility service territories in which the products and services offered must suit everyone and thinking is done on a meter by meter basis.Communities should be able to identify themselves and negotiate contracts with their utilities for the services that they need to move them toward their energy goals. The contracts may include commitments the communities make about how they will use the utility's system of resources and delivery and- as long as the community pays for the utility services it receives- it should have the authority to allocate that cost among itself as it makes sense and seek services from others to supplement the utility's services so that it can move toward cleaner energy.  This most easily works for a community that already has a governance structure- such as a city- town or even -- perhaps -- a homeowner's association.But ideally we can put enabling frameworks in law that allow other groups to identify as a community for purposes of clean energy goals.  This idea builds on community aggregation ideas that already exist in states that have restructured their electricity and natural gas markets.Communities can purchase green power for their members.But because that is all they can do- it is difficult to reach higher percentages of green power use because the power supplies don't match the community's use of energy.To accomplish this takes additional services that aren't available from most energy utilities.If the community could negotiate the services it receives- adding some and perhaps lowering the cost of others because of its ability to manage its use- it could move farther- faster toward a clean energy profile.And- in states that do not allow community aggregation- this could be the first step towards that.  A community could invest in the technologies or technology services necessary to see its current purchases of clean energy (if this option is available from its utility) and how those purchases match the communities' use of energy- as well as how its collective energy use fits in with the utility's system and costs of service.This could be the foundation on which to have a dialogue with the utility and its regulating or governing body and move the idea of community authority and responsibility forward.  This idea needs knowledge and expertise on community organizing and governance models and ideas on how to help energy utilities become receptive.It may or may not require legislative changes or additions.

 Any communication to the public- in order to hit the listeners hot buttons- must address the existential core need of the the listener. People can be categorized in some ways- and one of those is the vMeme intelligence that is active at the core.We all develop from the same beginning vMeme level and progress upward- with the leading edge appearing to be 7 levels above the beginning.Each level has a diff core need- and each successive level has a wider expanse of cognitive complexity.If we don't know these research confirmed levels- we can't be artful in how we communicate our message.If we do take this into account- our message will land right smack on the listeners' hot buttons!Details below.  Anyone designing policies- procedures and communications will be more effective- if they have a Yellow thinker advising on how the plan will serve all the vMeme levels in the population of interest.  The first thing to do is to ensure rapid transition to renewables actually provides satisfiers for the vMeme needs present in the population impacted.An arrogant assumption that it does- without input from those in these levels- will eventually confound the project. The classic solution here is to find the superordinate goal that all vMeme levels can subscribe to- e.g. A world where all thrive and help thrive.When a population believes this is the goal- they will align with it- and then the sub goals- of- say transition to renewablesif presented as a step toward the big goal-will have meaning- will make sense- will naturally engage these folk. Success in achieving a planetary community defined by Thrive and help thrive requires the design be done in at least 7 languages- Beige- Purple- Red- etc...  Learn the vMeme differences.The next time a tension emerges in an engagement- look for the vMeme behind the other's behavior.Take note of the vMeme behind your own behavior.Is there a mismatch?Did you happen to miss the core need expressed by the other...and now you can see it?Reshape your communication with this knowledge- and see what happens. This applies to intimate relationships- engagement with local politicians- work place relationships- and international engagements. The work of making this planet healthy for all- can't be done with the knowledge now present for most leaders....human differences must be integrated into all efforts or someone is left out- and success possibilities diminish.  I am almost done editing a 1000 page book of case studies of folks who have put this model to work in the real world.It is awesome- the stories the book will tell. I am here should anyone want more info about vMemes- its research focused originator- Claire W. Graves- its populizer- Dr. Don Beck- and anything related I can be of help with.My ideal is that all projects- have a vMeme Impact Study attached to them.There will be a vMeme impact from any program....best we have some notion of what we want it to be.

 Did you know that when your battery device stops working and you throw away the batteries there is nearly half the energy left inside the batteries?Did you know that 10 BILLION are discarded into the environment- rivers and oceans every year?Did you know that when you take your spent batteries to a recycling center they are just buried in landfills and not recycled?Nor did I... until I started looking with my designer eyes.So I used design thinking to invent a technology that can drain all the energy in a battery and make it available to the device.Devices can now run longer or use less batteries- and disposable battery waste can be cut in half.  This technology will immediately benefit everybody that uses handheld electronics that is run off of disposable batteries or replaceable rechargeable batteries.That electronics will run for longer or use less batteries than it does now.This means less batteries will be discarded every year.However- since I have started this I have found out that there is a 'gap' between the battery energy being used even in li-ion batteries (such as are used in your smartphone) and what the battery is safely capable of delivering.Current digital electronics has real difficulty accessing the last amounts of that energy.Some anecdotal data out of Finland puts this at 30% that could safely be used that is currently not being used.Obviously the main players are the battery manufacturers- but it is really not their fault.It is the fault of electronics inside the devices.Digital electronics will only work above a certain threshold and batteries still have energy available below that threshold.The sad thing is that once a device manufacturer has sold you their device they really don't care how many batteries you blow through or how short the life between charging is (This is changing with the fight between Samsung and Apple using life between changes as their product differentiation)  There is no question that rechargeable batteries are better than single use batteries.But there are always going to be occasions where single use batteries are necessary.They have a long shelf life- their energy is immediately available without any preparation (recharging)- and they have a high energy density in low to medium current drain electronics.Not only that- NiMH and NiCD rechargeable batteries are a much lower voltage than a regular Alkaline disposable battery.Consequently- they discharge much more quickly to the threshold where electronics cannot use the energy in the battery anymore.BatteryVampire Technology would allow all the safely usable energy to be used up in a rechargeable before it has to be recharged.They would run longer.  I am already in the process of conducting this experiment in the Kickstarter community.We costed out a Minimum Viable Product and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a minimum run of 2000 units of the 'Make One AA Battery act Like Two New Ones In A Device'.Although the people who have backed us are pretty committed to doing something about this waste- we have not made the jump to a bigger community of backers.We have had nearly 9000 video plays and 55% of those watched the full 3 minutes.However- this only resulted in ~175 backers.This has been great customer discovery for us- but it looks like saving battery waste is not as cool as some of the other offerings on Kickstarter.We will pivot and introduce another MVP that uses the technology in a different way so as to appeal to a different group of potential customers.However- the home run would be if we optimized and miniaturized this technology into a chip that could be included in all new devices.That would have the most impact.  I need circuit optimization and miniaturization help.I also need funding.So far I have funded this all myself and the Patent costs alone have been crippling.Lastly- I need people to get the word out there.Our biggest problem is that we have a technology that solves a problem that no one realizes that they are having.Most people think that when the batteries stop working in their Wii controller that they are dead.They are still very much alive.

 Powertype would use the kinetic energy from typing on a keyboard to power offices. In this case- specifically to light up a Living Wall recently installed by the San Francisco IDEO office. In order to get a better sense ofwhat this idea might look like like- wemapped what a day long experience might look like for an end user- named Marie- an operations manager at the San Francisco IDEO office.  The community is the San Francisco IDEO office. The average age is probably 35 and in general people are aware of the importance of renewable energy- but not necessarily of the energy we use in the office.  This idea identifies a friction point in our office - the lights that power our Living Wall and attempts to maintain their function of providing the right amount of intensity for our plants while taking into consideration how much energy they use. Through Powertype- we'll be able to keep our plants happy in a way that utilizes behaviors that already meet community needs - typing. If we can power the Living Wall lights through our typing- what else might that be applied to? And how can we think beyond typing to other kinetic activities happening in our office? Powertype creates awareness and functionality around switching to a renewable energy source by providing a readily visible result.  Talk to end users- such as the IDEO operations manager- and create a prototype of a button creating energy in order to determine if a keyboard- or network of keyboards- could in fact generate sufficient energy to power light bulbs. We could also observe analagous situations such as treadmill desks- or some of the Cycle Cinema contributions we saw during the Research phase.  I'd love to hear if the community has seen this happen anywhere or happens to know how much energy keyboard keys might generate. I'd also love to brainstorm around ways to use other office-driven habits (opening the fridge door- walking between printers and desks- refilling water bottles) as sources of renewable energy.

 Bicycle sharing works great-especiallyin cities- unless you have kids in tow every day or like me live where the weather is freezing and wet most days and the road is always uphill.Also- disabilities to think of.The big drawback for electric cars is price.Surely- like the bicycle sharing stations that are popping up in cities around the globe - lightweight cheap electric cars could be hosted (sponsored even- Coca Cola advertising on the side?) that recharge when parked at designated docking stations everywhere in the city. These are accessed through paid tickets. Maybe a global/national deal with Toyota for their new mass produced hydrogen car might reap a discount. Price is the drawback.  This idea would benefit anyone living in a city or large town- whether a family unit- single- disabled or anyone really.  Cars off the road- cheaper running costs- zero pollution- inclusion of all sectors of society even those who currently cant access transport. Jobs- industry- growth.  It would and is working with electric powered bicycles in Dublin- I see no reason why it cant be scaled up to shared electric cars that recharge when docked at drop off points.  All useful criticism and problem finding is welcome along with links to potential prototype lightweight car designs that are currently available.Maybe a deal with Toyota for their new mass produced hydrogen car might reap a discount  Electric vehicles ,0,0
