The Non-governmental organization (NGO) have to be funded by donations- and sometimes this is not a financial process. Because of this- they receive different types of products- and possibly these products don’t fulfill their needs in that time. In this sense- Doar will be a platform that could help the communication between this two parts and this process.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>Donation is a process that helps many people around the world to have a decent life. With Doar this process will be easier. As an example- according to Instituto Comunitario da Grande Florianopolis (ICom)- only in my city Florianopolis- SC/Brazil are more than two hundreds unities of NGO’s. With DOAR in this community- the donation process would be easier and more financially efficient for these organizations.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I could apply this project in Florianopolis- SC/Brazil- because the donation scene is really big. Furthermore- I could enter in contact with the NGO’s inviting them to participate of the project- showing the importance of the platform. As well- I could do a connection with the contributors- such as big companies of the region and philanthropists. Once this project was implemented in a city- will be easier to open for different locations and countries.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>The community of OpenIDEO could help with the ideation of new features and feedbacks. Also- the development of the digital platform could be a really good help!</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An individual</p>,2,2,3,3,3

The game puts users</p><h4>Who does this idea benefit- who are the main players and what's in it for them?</h4><p>Our project is targeted at low financial literacy audience- to educate them through edutainment and reach out to them via social. We believe the knowledge they equip from Invest Quest will educate them with sufficient knowledge & realistic stimulation- dealing with unforeseen/uncontrollable market conditions to kick- start their first investment. The game also includes advisor to facilitate the players to react on various financial conditions.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>The idea involves the communities in the world of virtual reality where- real cash flow concept is take into accounts. Therefore- market & transactions will be happen at real time- and the player's financial situation will be affected by the actions of the communities (e.g. high demand or low in supply will result in high pricing of a product or commodity).From this- the user will be able to learn the concept of careful financial planning and investment to improve their cash flow.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>I will like to develop a mobile prototype on the game concept on financial literacy to gather initial interests of the community before moving on to develop a second life environment where- the real 3D interaction will grab the interests of the audience at a visual level.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Coding on game development Graphical designGame concept on the financial literacy.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A student project or collaboration</p>,3,3,3,5,4

We will partner with a local bank- to offer RMG workers a savings product known as a DPS (Deposit Premium Scheme). This allows them to commit to a savings amount on a monthly basis for a fixed tenure- which can overlap with their anticipated tenure in the RMG sector. Thus- when they go back to their home villages they would have either met their goals or accrued enough to meet their savings goals.</p><h4>How is your idea specifically using the power of communities to improve financial opportunities and resources?</h4><p>From poor accessibility to a bank- to a lack of products catered to the needs and income flows of the poor- there are many barriers to engaging with the formal financial sector. This affects their friends and family equally- resulting in a lack of knowledge on how and where to save. Hence- they are in need of reliable sources for financial advice. We try to solve this problem by using work place networks to measure the effect of peers- managers and high-performing peers on saving decisions.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>The experiment will have two rounds. In the first round- we will offer the product to managers- high-performing workers and normal workers. In the second round- we will offer the product to workers under different information treatments. Some will learn of the take-up rates of managers- others peers or high-performing workers.A control group will be offered the product with no information and there will be also be a group that isn’t offered the product. Treatment assignment will be randomized.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>We are looking to place this idea on a platform where it can grow and gain support in terms of design from ideas on how a similar product can be rolled out in other practical settings. We also hope to benefit from the networks within the OpenIDEO community to disseminate our findings so that it can be further refined and applied in alternate settings.</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>A group brainstorm</p>,4,4,4,4,5

Quantified accountability within a community structure has proven wildly successful in the health and wellness space.Imagine if individuals struggling to pay just a little bit extra towards their student loan each month could find and support one another.</p><h4>What early- lightweight experiment can you try out in your own community to find out if the idea will meet your expectations?</h4><p>Prototype using a simple website- where individuals can report progress towards a specific financial goals. The website AskMeEvery is a great (simple!) platform that emails you every day and charts your responses. For example- did you stay within your food budget today?.</p><h4>What skills- input or guidance might you be seeking from the OpenIDEO community to help you build out or refine your idea further?</h4><p>Feedback or ideas about what types of goals people would want supported. We all have financial secrets- and we all often have the same financial secrets within our peer groups (I'm worried about saving enough for a house or I'm worried about my student loans). How can we create a supportive- simple- environment where people want to report their progress?</p><h4>This idea emerged from:</h4><p>An OpenIDEO Meetup</p>,3,3,3,3,3
